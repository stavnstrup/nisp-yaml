title: Transition Management Processes
description: The processes for Transition Management describe the activities to bring a new capability, unit, system, sub-system or enabling system into its operational environment, or to change the operational environment of an existing element, including the transfer of accountability and responsibility from one organizational entity to another (i.e. from development into operations). The main focus of the transition process is to establish and execute procedures to enable a controlled, well-managed start to the operations process (utilization and support). The process should be planned and organised over all lines of development (DOTMLPF-I) of the capability, all interfaces to other capabilities and the defined function and necessary support by the supply-chain (e.g. industry). Though it is common to think of the transition from capability development to fielding as a point in time, transition is actually a process that takes place over time. The transition process is a set of activities in a sequential, phased order. # Planning Transition # Preparing Transition # Hand-off to Operations # Close Transition Potential transition approaches include  * Big Bang Transition -- Outputs are all put into operation through a single transition. * Staged Transition -- Outputs are introduced such that they provide an initial operational capability (IOC) that gives (some) benefit. The transition of further outputs then builds on this until a full operational capability (FOC) is realized. * Phased Transition -- Outputs are transitioned in a phased manner across the organization. Users regarded as 'more capable' are transitioned first, with their experience used to inform and improve the transition approach for successive user transition phases. The approach to transition adopted is documented in the Capability Programme Transition Plan. This plan defines the overall approach to transition and must be closely aligned with the following  * The Integration, Test & Evaluation approach to ensure that only Outputs with known sufficient quality are transitioned into operation. * The Business Change approach to ensure the organization is ready, able and supported to receive the Outputs transitioned. It includes methods that redirect or redefine the use of resources, business process, budget allocations, people or other modes of operation that significantly change an organization. * Benefits Measurement to ensure measurement of benefits realized from Outputs starts during transition (i.e. when these benefits start to be realized). Retirement is a special case of transition. It is the set of processes and activities associated with the removal, withdrawal, or decommissioning of a capability from its operational environment. Although one might try to distinguish retirement activities from deployment activities, the two processes are extremely similar in many respects, although one adds to the operational environment and one subtracts from it.
