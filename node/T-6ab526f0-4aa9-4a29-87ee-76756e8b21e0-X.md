title: Collective Defence (CD)
description: The Collective Defence (CD) mission type results from the invocation of NATO's article 5 which states that an armed attack against one or more NATO Nations shall be considered an attack upon them all. Consequently, the NATO Nations agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.
