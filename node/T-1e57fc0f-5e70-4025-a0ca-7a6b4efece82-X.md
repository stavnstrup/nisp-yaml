title: Joint ISR Processes
description: The Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR or Joint ISR) Processes provide the foundation for provision of JISR capabilities in support of a Commander's objectives and requirements. The fundamental steps within the JISR cycle that would be conducted are Task, Collect, Process, Exploit, and Disseminate. These steps may be conducted in part or in full at the tactical level, such as at ISR detachments and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) teams, but may also involve those at the operational level, such as J2 collection managers and Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC) ISR Division (ISRD) staff, depending on the activities and situation encountered.
