title: Peacekeeping (PK)
description: The Peacekeeping (PK) mission type consists of activities that are generally undertaken in accordance with the principles of Chapter VI of the UN Charter in order to monitor and facilitate the implementation of a peace agreement. The loss of consent or the development of a non-compliant party may limit the freedom of action of the PK force and even threaten the continuation of the mission or cause it to evolve into a Peace Enforcement (PE) operation. Thus, the conduct of PK is driven by the requirement to build and retain perceived legitimacy.
