title: Initiate Planning
description: During this stage, commanders create a foundation from which they will develop their plans. They analyze current state (situational analysis) and have a preliminary look at possible future opportunities and threats. They examine organization's strengths and weaknesses. Commanders at this point must have an understanding of "why we wish to solve uncertainties, and a vision of what we expect to gain by when.". Commanders need to determine (a) what threats to achieving the organization's objectives are developing and (b) how changes in the environment present opportunities for greater achievement of those objectives. Once commanders decide on a mission and an associated timeframe they formulate their intent and establish high level goals and objectives to provide direction for the planning activities of the entire organization.
