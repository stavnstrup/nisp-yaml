title: Land Operations
description: The Land Operations Processes aim to put a plan into action by applying combat power to accomplish the mission and using situational awareness to assess progress and make execution and adjustment decisions. Inherent in the Land Operations Process is deciding to execute planned actions, such as phases, branches and sequels, as well as deciding to change the plan based on changes in the situation. During the Land Operations Process the commander directs the application of combat power, ensuring adequate, but not excessive, synchronization. He must maintain continuity of operations so as to prevent the enemy from regaining his equilibrium. The Land Operations Process entails much more than just putting the plan into action. Executing is a continuous process of four activities  # Monitoring the ground situation to allow commanders to assess the situation; # Assessing the current state and forecasting progress of the operation; # Making execution and adjustment decisions to account for unforeseen enemy actions and exploit opportunities; # Directing actions to apply combat power to accomplish the mission. During execution changes occur, some from effective or ineffective action by the enemy or friendly forces, and some from changes within the environment. Successful execution depends on identifying and adapting to one or a combination of changes in these elements. The Land Operations Processes incorporate two methods for adapting to changes. The first method (included within Land Tactical Planning Processes), consists of anticipating changes and developing branches and sequels to the plan to deal with them. Anticipating changes does not end with planning; it continues throughout preparation and execution, especially during execution. Study and development help the commander apply analysis and judgment to understand a situation, establish valid, realistic criteria for decisions, and comprehend the relationships in command to anticipate events and consequences. The second method of adapting to change is improvising, taking action or adopting solutions to unforecasted changes during the operation. While improvisation is not preferred, situations frequently arise requiring its use. The real difference between the methods is time  anticipation occurs when the enemyâ€™s actions are foreseen early enough to develop an analytical response. Improvising occurs when the enemy action is unexpected and does not allow time for formal planning of a response.
