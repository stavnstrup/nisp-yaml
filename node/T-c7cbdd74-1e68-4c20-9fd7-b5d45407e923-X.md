description: The Joint Applications enable users to collect, process, present and distribute information that supports the major functions of joint operations. Joint Operations are the set of military activities that are conducted by joint forces and those service forces employed in specified command relationships with each other, which of themselves do not establish joint forces. In case these joint operations are carried out by military forces of two or more nations, these are known as Combined Joint Operations.
