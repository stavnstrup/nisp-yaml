title: Assess Capabilities
description: Capabilities define what an organization needs to be able to do, in order to successfully achieve the outcomes that are defined as part of the overall strategy. They are the key building blocks of the defence enterprise, unique and independent from each other, and tend to be stable over time. Defence enterprises consist of a portfolio of capabilities that are used in various combinations to achieve outcomes. Within that portfolio, a capability will be transient unless managed and maintained over time. Therefore, a typical capability lifecycle spans requirements, development and acquisition, in-service and obsolescence/disposal phases. A Capability map is a map of the defence enterprise that compiles and visualizes its capabilities in a particular (life-cycle) state, for example current capabilities and their current maturity level, planned or required capabilities in a future state. Each key capability can be made more specific by decomposition. From a top down perspective, capabilities are derived from the strategic direction of the defence enterpriser. From a bottom up perspective, components and assets can be linked to the capabilities they support, providing an indirect link of these components and assets with strategic direction. In this way, capabilities can be used as a starting point for the definition of portfolios of defence assets (e.g. Weapon Systems, C2/C4ISR/CIS Systems etc.). Comparing requirements with the Capability Map allows identifying capability gaps and associated risks and determining impacts on reaching the strategic objectives of the defence enterprise.
