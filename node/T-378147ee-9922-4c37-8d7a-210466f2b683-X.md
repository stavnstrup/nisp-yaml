title: Generate the Strategic Management Plan
description: The Strategic Management Plan directs the strategic management of a Strategic Command, defining the overall mission and vision and setting the objectives. Its primary role is to synchronise operational requirements, resources and capabilities ensuring a realistic, balanced and efficient accomplishment of a Strategic Command tasks, monitored by a performance measurement and risk-management tool. In addition to these high level inputs, there are many other events which do not require the involvement of a Strategic Command’s Executive principals but that of a Strategic Command’s staff principals or senior staff. These activities are not a formal part of a Strategic Command’s high-level business processes and activities but they provide input for these activities. Strategic HQ senior staff and DCOSs are responsible for including these activities in their business processes and coordinating them with a Strategic Command’s high-level business processes.
