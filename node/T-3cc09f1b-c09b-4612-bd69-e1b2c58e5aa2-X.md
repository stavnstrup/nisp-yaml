title: Cyberspace Domain Services
description: The Cyberspace Domain Services provide unique computing and information services in support of Cyberspace Operations. Cyberspace operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace - the global domain created by communication, information and other electronic systems, their interaction and the information that is stored, processed or transmitted in these systems. Cyberspace capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander’s plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations. Typically, cyberspace operations are conducted to obtain or retain freedom of maneuver in cyberspace, to accomplish joint force commander’s objectives, deny freedom of action to the threat, and enable operations in the other operational domains.
