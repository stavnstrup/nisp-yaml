title: Standardization Processes
description: The Standardization Processes describe the activities for the development and implementation of standards based on the consensus of different parties. Nations need to share a common set of standards, especially among military forces, to carry out multinational operations. Standardization allows for more efficient use of resources and thus enhances the operational effectiveness of military forces. Standardization helps to maximize compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, or quality. Cooperating with partners greatly increases the effectiveness of a nation's defence capabilities when conducting operations. Nations need to also cooperated in the development of their military forces to achieve interoperability â€“ the ability of diverse systems and organisations to operate together - and to prevent duplication and promote better use of economic resources. Standards are normally classified into one of three main areas as follows, although some standards may apply to more than one area  * Operational standards -- standards which affect future and/or current military practice, procedures or formats. They may apply among other things, to such matters as concepts, doctrine, tactics, techniques, logistics, training, organizations, reports, forms, maps and charts. * Materiel standards -- standards which affect the characteristics of future and/or current materiel to include telecommunications, data processing and distribution. They may cover production codes of practice as well as materiel specifications. Materiel includes complete systems, including command, control and communications systems, weapons systems, sub-systems, assemblies, components, spare parts and materials and consumables (including ammunition, fuel, supplies, stores and consumable spares). * Administrative standards -- standards concerning terminology - which apply to both the "operational" and the "materiel" fields - but this category also includes standards which facilitate an organization's administration in fields without direct military application (e.g. reporting of economic statistics).
