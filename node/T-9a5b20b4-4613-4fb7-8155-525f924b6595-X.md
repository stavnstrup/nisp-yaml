title: Develop Plan
description: After a preferred Course of Action and the associated outline plan has been adopted, it is necessary to develop derived plans for each segment of the organization to support the main plan and to finalize the main plan. Typically the objectives for derivative plans are formulated as the results to be attained and the purpose of the outputs in the context of the main plan, not how to achieve them. To synchronize actions, the detailed dependencies and sequencing of activities are determined and deconflicted. Planners typically establish control measures to aid cooperation among the different segments without imposing needless restriction on freedom of action. Contingency plan may be devised for an outcome other than in the selected plan. Contingency plans are used for risk management for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have severe consequences for mission success.
