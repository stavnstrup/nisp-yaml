title: Infrastructure Metering Services
description: The Infrastructure Metering Services measures the utilization of Infrastructure resources over specific period of times. Metering measures levels of resource utilization such as number of VMs created and used, CPU cycles/time, allocated amount of RAM, incoming and outgoing network bandwidth, data storage volume, etc. over various periods of time (e.g. second, hour, week, month, year). Calculated average values of the measurements can be then used to enforce Service Level Agreements (SLAs), load balancing, for billing purposes and overall usage trend forecasting.
