title: Domain-specific Operations
description: The deployment and exploitation of military instruments of power are greatly influenced by the environment in which forces, systems and services must operate. Traditionally, this had resulted in a separation of doctrine and principles of warfare for physically separated domains and consequently, the need to coordinate and align activities where these domains interact or join. More recently, this approach has also resulted in the recognition of non-physical domains. Most nations now recognize an overarching domain for the joint employment of services and five separate operational domains, for which domain-specific business processes are defined that are not replicated at the joint level. * Joint -- Joint Operations * Air -- Air Operations * Sea -- Maritime Operations * Land -- Land Operations * Space -- Space Operations * Cyberspace -- Cyberspace Operations
