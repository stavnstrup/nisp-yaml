description: The "Policy and Guidance" taxonomy layer represents NATO's political and military ambitions. These ambitions are based on a Strategic Concept that serves as the Alliance's roadmap. Derived political and military guidance reflects the political, military, economic, legal, civil and technological factors which could (and should) impact the development of the capabilities that are required to fulfill the ambitions. Furthermore, this level captures the policies and other reference documents that guide and support capability development, implementation and sustainment.
