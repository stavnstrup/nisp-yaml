title: Function-specific Operations
description: Operations take place in and across five different operational domains, and one of the aspects that binds these all together in a joint fashion is that they all are dependent on the availability and provision of military functions that complement their domain-specific capabilities. Countries may have a different appreciation of the breakdown structure of these military functions, but in general the identification and recognition of these military functions is commonly accepted. Within the context of the Business Processes taxonomy a list of military functions is included. BY no means this is intended to be regarded as a complete list, and over time more functions may be incorporated, or functions may merge under different definitions. * Intelligence * Joint Targeting * Joint Fires * Special Operations * Force Protection * Counter-IED * Personnel Recovery * Electronic Warfare * Logistic Support * Medical Support * CIS * CIMIC * Military Engineering * Strategic Communications
