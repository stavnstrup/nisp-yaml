title: Business Processes
description: The purpose of the "Business Processes" taxonomy layer is to define a framework for business process in defence enterprises by the provision of  * a common language that allows comparing and linking process architectures of different organizations; * a foundation structure for classifying processes into groups of related processes; * a checklist or starting point for identifying candidate processes undertaken within your organization; and * a basis for determining how process ownership can be assigned. In this context, a "defence enterprise" at its most basic level is composed of a ministry or department of defence - which is that part of the government that is responsible for matters of defence and that usually includes all branches of the military - plus the military forces - the professional organizations and units delivering the military instruments of power. A defence enterprise typically carries out the following four core functions. * Govern -- to direct defence policy, military operations at the strategic level, as well as direct rules and standards applying to the entire defence enterprise whilst maintaining accountability for defence activity and spending. * Generate -- to develop and create military forces, including the acquisition of the equipment, systems and other items needed so that military units are ready for operations. * Operate -- to command and carol military forces domestically and abroad, and employing the military instruments of power. * Enable -- to allow and empower the defence enterprise to work properly by providing supporting services. The Business Processes taxonomy is a means of grouping processes from these four core functions into appropriately related categories. It serves as a reference model that provides typical business processes that can be re-used and adapted to design a new business process architecture. (This taxonomy itself is not a Business Process Architecture that can be adopted 1 1 by any organization). Within this taxonomy individual process areas are comparable to commercial domains. For instance, the IT services industry uses reference models like COBIT and eTOM, whereas the logistics industry uses SCOM or VRM; these models can be easily adopted to the specific process areas and functions within the defence enterprise. Whilst these individual domains are comparable, the overall macro-level perspective of a defence enterprise is unique, as defence differs in several key ways from the commercial sector. There is no single indicator of value of overall defence output which is generally regarded as stability and security provided to the country within the context of the wider international system. This contrasts with the valuation of commercial sector outputs in market economies. Consequently, the existing - commercially oriented - business process frameworks can't be used directly within a defence context and must be embedded into a wider political-military context.
