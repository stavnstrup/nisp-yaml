title: Establish Planning Guidance
description: The process for Establish Planning Guidance describes activities to develop a unified guidance document for defence planning which sets out the overall aims and objectives to be met. The highest-level guidance document is published at the political level, and that document should be agreed at the highest civilian / political levels to represent an expression of the goals of the governing body. A subordinate military guidance for planning, coming from senior military leaders, may provide further details and clarification of the political guidance and take specific military judgement on achieving the aims and objectives into account.
