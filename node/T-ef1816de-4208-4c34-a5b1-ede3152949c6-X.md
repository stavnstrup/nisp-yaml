title: Maintain the Plan
description: Most commanders put together a plan to initiate an operations and gain and organize the required resources. A plan is not a one-time document, at least it shouldnâ€™t be. Ultimately, a plan is about results, about achieving mission success and declaring an operation completed. However, it's rare that everything goes according to plan. Therefore it is important to regularly review planned vs. actual results, and to conduct a practical analysis of the reasons for variance so that planners can plan course corrections or fine tune the plan. During preparation revising and refining the main plan and the supporting plans is a key activity. The Maintain the Plan process ensures that the overall plan is up-to-date and as accurate as possible. Communication synchronization is a process that helps implement guidance by coordinating, synchronizing, and ensuring the integrity and consistency of top-down narratives, themes, messages, images, and actions throughout a operation across all relevant communication activities.
