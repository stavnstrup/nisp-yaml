title: Modelling and Simulation Services
description: The Modelling and Simulation (M&S) Services provide unique computing and information services for modelling and simulation support to operations including the means to manage, compose and control simulation resources. It supports the set of activities that are undertaken to use models, emulators, simulators, and stimulators, to develop data in support of decision making. Each simulation requires well-defined models, information resources, rules, behaviours and constraints, which are authoritative and managed. One or more simulations are executed and controlled to achieve the outputs required by follow on simulations, processes and/or decision makers. The simulation environment allows for the modelling of multiple entities, their behaviours and interactions to determine the likely results.
