title: Conflict Prevention (CP)
description: The Conflict Prevention (CP) mission type consists of activities that are normally conducted in accordance with the principles of Chapter VI of the UN Charter. These activities may include  diplomatic, economic, or information initiatives; actions designed to reform a countryâ€™s security sector and make it more accountable to democratic control; or deployment of forces designed to prevent or contain disputes from escalating to armed conflict. Military assets used for Conflict Prevention should generally be focused on the support they provide to the political and developmental efforts to mitigate the causes of societal tensions and unrest. This can be before the commencement of intervention, or during or after intervention in order to protect and consolidate the reform and development process. Military activities will be tailored to meet political and developmental demands but include  early warning, surveillance, and preventative deployment.
