title: Conformity Assessment
description: Conformity Assessment Processes include the activities for assessing the conformity of products, processes, services and management systems to appropriate standards or other technical specifications using methods such as testing and inspection. There is significant overlap with [[Evaluation Processes]]. The assessment of products, processes and services may be carried out either by the provider of the product or service or by an independent conformity assessment organization. Conformity Assessment should be performed before products, processes and services are acquired by the organization.
