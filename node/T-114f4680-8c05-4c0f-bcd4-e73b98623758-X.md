title: Sourcing Processes
description: The processes for Sourcing describe activities to ensure that all material, weapon systems, facilities and/or related services and supplies are delivered in line with the appropriate requirements and based on suitable agreements. Agreements between the partners are necessary to procure product and services on schedule and set up the required supply chains, within defined costs and with a specific performance. These key elements must be in balance.
