title: Plan National Industrial Specialisation
description: When under budgetary pressure, Nations often make unilateral decisions when shaping their equipment plans. When this happens, other nations can fall under an increased obligation to maintain certain capabilities. Such specialisation "by default" is the inevitable result of uncoordinated budget cuts. The alliance should encourage specialisation "by design" so that members concentrate on their national strengths and agree to coordinate planned defence budget cuts with the Allies. This process then ensures that the alliance retains highly specialised capabilities within the industrial bases of its members without compromising national requirements.
