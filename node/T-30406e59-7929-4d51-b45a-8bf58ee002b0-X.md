title: Wired Wide Area Transmission Services
description: The Wired Wide Area Transmission Services support physical transfer of data, point-to-point or point-to multipoint, using high capacity wired transmission medium over long distances. Examples of transmission media are copper leased lines and optical fibre. The capabilities of these services are defined by the characteristics of the transmission media, which enables wavelength-based multiplexing and switching, seamless transport of ATM, Ethernet, etc. Examples of Wired Wide Area Transmission Services, associated with the supporting technology employed, are Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM), Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), and Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH).
