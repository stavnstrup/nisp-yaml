title: Validation Processes
description: The processes for Validation describe the assurance activities to ensure that a capability, unit, individual product, service or system satisfies the operational needs of the user in the intended environment. The validation process provides objective evidence that the element under investigation, when used, fulfils its mission objectives within a specified (intended) operational environment. It is intended to prove through the lifecycle that the ‘right system has been built’ for the intended purpose. Both Verification and Validation are critical components of a quality management system and are defined during the development of the operational, capability and system level requirements. For technical systems, the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 standard identifies three activities to be performed as Validation processes  # Prepare for validation # Perform validation # Manage results of validation
