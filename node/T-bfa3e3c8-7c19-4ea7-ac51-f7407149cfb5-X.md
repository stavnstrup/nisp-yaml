title: Evaluate Alternatives
description: After determining the alternative Courses of Action and having made an analysis of their strong and weak points, planners evaluate the alternatives in the light of premises and goals. Evaluation is not an easy process because alternatives have so many variables and limitations. Some alternatives can be seen through, some may appear to promise a high potential for mission success but may require too much resources. Some may be less desirable or efficient than others; still another may better suit the organization's immediate goals. Hence, planners evaluate and compare alternatives against the considerations for both feasibility, consequences and risks. Structured decision support tools can support the complex evaluation process.
