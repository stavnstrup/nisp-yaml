title: Joint Fires Processes
description: The processes for Joint Fires describe the activities necessary to provide the ability to use kinetic and non-kinetic means in to generate the desired lethal and/or non-lethal effects from all domains of operations. Joint Fires enable the coordinated and integrated employment of land-, air- and naval fire support platforms delivering indirect firepower to achieve the required effects on ground targets to support Land Operations in the full spectrum of conflict. The processes encompass the integration of indirect fires and effects to influence the adversary forces, installations or functions or to maintain freedom of movement. The two broad categories of targets are planned and immediate. Planned targets are targets that are known to exist in an operational area and against which attacks have been scheduled in advance (see [[Joint Targeting Processes]]) or are on-call. Immediate targets, either unplanned or unanticipated, are targets that have been identified too late to be included in the normal targeting process, and therefore, have not been scheduled.
