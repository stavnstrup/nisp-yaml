title: Simulation Composition Services
description: The Simulation Composition Services provide the means to define and execute complex simulations composed of an orchestration of multiple simulations working cooperatively to provide a required output. The orchestration of simulations can include both concurrent and sequential execution of simulations. The outputs of one simulation may provide the input to another for both concurrent and sequentially running simulations. The results, whether discrete or continuous, are provided to the consumer as required.
