title: Direct Strategic Response
description: Writing an organisation's strategic response will necessitate an enduring process of strategic thinking underpinned by enhanced understanding. In turn, that will require strategic situational awareness of the current environment and the ability to exercise strategic anticipation of what might happen in the future. Those levels of understanding will take time to acquire and will necessitate significant engagement with affiliates, partners, academia and other stakeholders. Key steps to developing a strategic response include  * Achieving an enhanced understanding of ends, ways and means as they apply to an organisation’s instruments of influence. * Setting appropriate objectives in line with strategic requirements and determining priorities against those. * Accounting for the need to coordinate employment of all levers of influence to achieve the organisation’s strategic objectives. The strategy will also need to reflect the reality that many challenges require a comprehensive approach across the global community involving a wide spectrum of instruments of influence. * Determining and agreeing the effects that the organisation’s instruments of influence will be required to deliver. * Developing metrics and measures of effect to allow assessment of the delivery of effects against ends to ensure that the organisation’s instruments of influence are employed efficiently and coherently to maximise its outputs and the effects achieved. * Ensuring that the strategy is aligned with extant planning and capability development processes, which will secure the means required for its successful implementation.
