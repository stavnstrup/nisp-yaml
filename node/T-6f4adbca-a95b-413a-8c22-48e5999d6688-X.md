title: Training Development Processes
description: The processes for Training Development align the military training strategy with assigned missions to produce trained and ready individuals, staffs, and units. Training Processes enable leaders to plan, prepare, execute, and assess training, education, and leader development across the operational, institutional, and self-development training domains. The main training processes are focused on  # Identify training needs # Design training # Develop training # Implement and deliver training (event) # Evaluate training and assess trainman results # Maintain training More specifically, the training processes provide a capabilities-based method for aligning training programmes with assigned missions consistent with command priorities, capabilities (both current and proposed), and available resources. Training includes mission rehearsals, of individuals, staffs, and units, using doctrine or tactics, techniques, and procedures, to prepare military forces and staffs to respond to strategic, operational, or tactical requirements considered necessary by commanders at all echelons to execute their assigned or anticipated missions. The application of the training processes is deliberate in concept, but must be flexible in execution. The main objective of the execution of training processes is to ensure the military forces are trained and prepared to employ a broad portfolio of military capabilities that offer versatility across the full spectrum of mission requirements. The two main types of training are collective and individual training. * Collective training -- the training of a group of individuals (from crews, teams, squads to entire headquarters staff) to do tasks required of a group as a whole. * Individual training -- the training an individual receives, either in training institutions or units, that prepares the individual to do specified duties and tasks.
