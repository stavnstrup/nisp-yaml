title: Circuit-based Aggregation Services
description: The Circuit-based Aggregation Services involve the termination of multiple tributary circuits (e.g. E1), each providing circuit-based transport services to different network nodes, and multiplexing them into an aggregate rate (e.g. 16x E1 lines at 2 Mbps each, multiplexed into one E3 line at 34 Mbps).
