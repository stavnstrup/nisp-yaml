description: The processes for Testing are broken down into an iterative five-step approach that provides objective evidence for decision makers at various times during capability development. The process begins during the formative stages of a capability development programme with the Coordination Function for V&V and Testing, in which the information needs of the various decision makers are formulated in conjunction with the development of the programme requirements, acquisition strategy, and Analysis of Alternatives. # Assess Testability # Plan Test # Execute Test # Analyze Test Results # Report Test Results
