title: Electronic Warfare Applications
description: The Electronic Warfare (EW) Applications enable users to collect, process, present and distribute information that supports the major functions of Electronic Warfare operations. Electronic Warfare is the set of military activities that are conducted by designated forces to exploit the electromagnetic spectrum by interception and identification of emissions, by preventing hostile use of the spectrum, and by actions to ensure its effective use by friendly forces in support of operations. Electronic Warfare Applications will be used to plan, coordinate, and monitor Electronic Support Measures (ESM), Electronic Countermeasures (ECM), and Electronic Protection Measures (EPM). These applications will be used by the Joint Electronic Warfare Centre staff and Electronic Warfare staff at joint and component command levels.
