description: Recommendation of award is an essential step in the contracting process. It provides for independent written advice on the acceptability of the Procurement Process undertaken, and the proposed commitment of funds by the procurement authority, through contracts or Purchase Orders. Award is the formal decision and approval to establish a contract or a Purchase Order with the successful supplier, based on independent review of the Procurement Process within the limits of awarding authority. The award phase marks the successful conclusion of the Procurement Process, and at the same time, the starting point for contract finalization and execution.
