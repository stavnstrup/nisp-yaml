title: Decision and Directive Execution
description: The Decision and Directive Execution Process provides the operations assessment which is critical to inform the military and political leadership on progress being made towards achieving objectives and the end state. This, in turn, allows for adjustments to be made to the plan or in extraordinary cases, adjusting the end state. A periodic mission review is an important activity for providing these assessments to the highest military commanders and the government. Military operations are conducted under dynamic conditions where changes in the strategic and operational environment are constantly happening. The Government and the highest military commanders require a feedback process in order to determine the effectiveness of military operations and make recommendations for changes. A governmental execution directive authorizes putting a military operation into effect.
