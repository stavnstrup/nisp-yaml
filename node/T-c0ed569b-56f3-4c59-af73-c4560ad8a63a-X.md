title: Requirements Engineering Processes
description: The processes for Requirements Engineering describe the activities in support of the definition, documentation and maintenance of requirements in the Capability Development process. These activities vary widely, depending on the type of capability being developed and the specific practices of the organization(s) involved. These processes are represented in six different steps. These are sometimes presented as chronological stages although, in practice, there is considerable interleaving of these activities. In larger programmes and projects, requirements are usually not stable and never completely modelled and design activities will start while the requirements are still under investigation. # Requirements inception or requirements elicitation -- developers and stakeholders meet, the latter are inquired concerning their needs and wants regarding the capability solution. # Requirements analysis and negotiation -- requirements are identified (including new ones if the development is iterative) and conflicts with stakeholders are solved. # Architecture concept development -- this concept must not be confused with the formal architecture model of the capability . It is targeted at external stakeholders; it is informal and presents the essential concepts of the architecture in notations and words that are comfortable for the stakeholders. # Requirements specification -- requirements are documented in a formal artifact called a Requirements Specification (RS), which will become official only after validation. # Requirements validation -- checking that the documented requirements and models are consistent and meet the needs of the stakeholder. Only if the final draft passes the validation process, the Requirements Specification becomes official. # Requirements management -- managing all the activities related to the requirements since inception, supervising as the system is developed and, even until after it is put into use.
