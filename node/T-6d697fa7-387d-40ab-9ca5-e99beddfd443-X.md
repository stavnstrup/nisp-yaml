title: Modelling and Simulation Applications
description: The Modelling and Simulation (M&S) Applications enable users to collect, process, present and distribute information for modelling and simulation support to operations. Modelling and Simulation are the set of (military) activities that are undertaken to use models, including emulators, prototypes, simulators, and stimulators, either statically or over time, to develop data as a basis for making operational or managerial decisions. It is important to recognize that assumptions, conceptualizations, and implementation constraints influence the practical results of simulations, while proper use of M&S techniques and procedures can still produce invaluable contributions to military decision making.
