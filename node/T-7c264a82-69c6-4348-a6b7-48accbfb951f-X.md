title: Determine Requirements
description: The process to Determine Requirements takes the guidance and identifies the complete set of capabilities considered necessary to meet the quantitative and qualitative ambitions set out therein. A structured, comprehensive, transparent and traceable process, which uses analytical support tools and relevant subject matter expert analysis, will be utilized. The output of this analysis is a single set of requirements that spans the planning horizon from short to long-term, to support the efforts of all planning domains. The process uses, amongst other things, intelligence, results from previous planning cycles, including responses to Capability Reviews, established conceptual analyses and lessons learned both from operations and exercises as well as other activities.
