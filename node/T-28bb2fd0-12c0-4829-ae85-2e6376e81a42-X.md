title: Peacebuilding (PB)
description: The Peacebuilding (PB) mission type consists of activities that support political, economic, military, and social measures through comprehensive approaches and that are aimed at strengthening political settlements of a conflict. Thus, for a society to regenerate and become self-sustaining, it must address the constituents of a functioning society. Peacebuilding includes mechanisms to identify and support structures that will consolidate peace, foster a sense of confidence and well-being, and support economic reconstruction. Peacebuilding therefore requires the commitment of political, humanitarian and development resources to a long-term political process.
