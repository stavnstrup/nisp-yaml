title: Wired Local Area Transmission Services
description: The Wired Local Area Transmission Services support physical transfer of data, point-to-point or point-to multipoint, using wired transmission medium amongst two or more static nodes over relatively short distances. Examples of transmission media are copper wires (two-wire, four-wire, twisted pair, coaxial, etc.) and optical fibre. Examples of Wired Local Area Transmission Services, associated with the supporting technology employed, are telephony, local loop circuit to access leased lines, Local Area Network (LAN), and video distribution. Within this context a LAN is considered to interconnect network nodes over a relatively short distance, generally within a single location (i.e. building, office). It is also possible for a LAN to span a group of closely co-located locations.
