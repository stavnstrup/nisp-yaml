title: Recognized Intelligence Picture Services
description: The Recognized Intelligence Picture (RIP) Services provide the means to produce, manage and disseminate the Recognized Intelligence Picture (RIP). The RIP is the compilation of validated data relating to a defined area of interest that is disseminated to enable situational awareness and support decision making at all levels. Most intelligence is derived from a single source. However, there are significant advantages to be derived from the deliberate application of two or more discrete but supporting intelligence disciplines - e.g. Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT) or Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) - seeking to improve the quality of the Recognized Intelligence Picture. The RIP Services will support the development of the RIP through the collection, aggregation, correlation and fusion of intelligence from multiple sources.
