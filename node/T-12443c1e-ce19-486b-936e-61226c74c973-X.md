title: Analytical Support Processes
description: The processes detailed here represent the activities that are conducted to support the organisation's decision making process outside of specific operational contexts. Elements of the Analytical Support Processes may be implemented as components of a wider function or domain process, but except where there are analytical processes specific to certain environments, analytical functions here are described as enabling processes for the entire organisation. There is significant relationship between the Analytical Support Processes and the Data Science Processes, and these have been represented independently as far as organisational structure permits.
