title: Force Health Protection
description: Force Health Protection (FHP) measures are an essential element of every operational plan. Elements of the FHP programme, such as vaccination, may in fact be the decisive factor on how quickly an operation can commence, and protective measures will frequently require implementation as soon as the decision is taken to commit to action. The plan will continue throughout the deployment and must extend well into the post-deployment period.
