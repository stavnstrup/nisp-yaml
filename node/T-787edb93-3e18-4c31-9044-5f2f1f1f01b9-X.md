title: Transport SMC Services
description: The Transport Service Management and Control (SMC) Services provide the necessary means to implement and enforce SMC policies at the communications transport level. The Transport SMC Services are loosely based on the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) Service Strategy. Examples of ITIL lifecycle process that can be employed are Strategy, Design, Transition, Operations, and Improvement. Within the context of SMC for all Communications Services, the functions and subsequent requirements on each the three layers - Communications Access Services, Transport Services and Transmission Services - experience a great overlap and high level of similarity. Therefore all SMC Services for these layers are defined under [[Communications Access SMC Services]], while they are valid for this layer just the same.
