title: Select Course of Action
description: This is the point at which the basic concept of the operation (CONOPS) is adopted by the leader â€“ the point of decision making. The CONOPS is stating "what" will be done. Normally, commanders will select the alternative that, in their judgement, will best enable the organization to accomplish the mission. After selecting the most appropriate course of action the "how" part needs to be developed and stated in the operations plan and supporting plans.
