title: Medical Functional Services
description: The Medical Functional Services provide the means to collect and disseminate accurate, complete and timely information on medical issues and actions, some of which may be sensitive and involve legal liability. The management of medical data and information is a fundamental aspect of medical support. Adequate documentation of medical care given, health status and location of personnel and environmental threats is part of a continuum of patient treatment and care, and is therefore, a medical responsibility. The services deliver unique computing and information services  to support medical command and control; to serve as an interface for the exchange of health information between different mission participants, and to allow clinical health data to be transmitted between mission participants.
