title: Technology Readiness Assessment Processes
description: A Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) is a formal, systematic, metrics- based process and accompanying report that evaluates the maturity of critical hardware and software technology elements of a capability. The TRA frequently uses a maturity scale - technology readiness levels (TRLs) - that are ordered according to the characteristics of the demonstration or testing environment under which a given technology was tested at defined points in time. TRAs are point in time evaluations that provide a snapshot of how a critical technology has been demonstrated by a certain point in its development. TRAs can be conducted and updated with regular frequency throughout the Capability Development process, and there is no pre-determined number of evaluations or time intervals for conducting these evaluations. # Define TRA Strategy # Prepare Individual TRA # Select Critical Technologies # Evaluate Tritical Technologies # Report TRA Results # Plan Technology Maturation
