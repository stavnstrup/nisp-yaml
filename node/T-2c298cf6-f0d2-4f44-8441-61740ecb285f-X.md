title: Monitoring
description: Monitoring involves measuring ongoing activities that may impact the operating environment or impact ongoing or future operations. The baseline for this measurement is the plan which allows the staff to assess the current status against the one envisioned in the plan. The commander and staff identify where the current situation deviates from the one envisioned in the plan. Although staff sections monitor their individual staff functions to maintain current staff estimates, the preponderance of the organisations monitoring function is conducted by dedicated monitoring cells, and is depicted visually through the Common Operating Picture display
