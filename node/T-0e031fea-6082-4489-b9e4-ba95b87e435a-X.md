title: Information Registry Services
description: The Information Registry Services provides the means to store, manage and retrieve references to authoritative information required for execution of simulation models. The Information Registry Services facilitates the retrieval of metadata associated with the authoritative information reference, including the provenance, semantics, structure and the means to retrieve the information. The Information Registry Services allows the outputs of a simulation model to be registered and utilized as the inputs for future simulations. The authoritative information may not come from a single source, but instead be the result of aggregation, correlation, mediation and/or orchestration.
