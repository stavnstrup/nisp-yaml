title: Overlay Services
description: The Overlay services provide the means to collect battlespace information from multiple sources for the purpose of geographic visualization, including annotation of maps and images. Geographic visualization includes not only the presentation of graphical data on the globe/map, but also allow drilling down from rendered battlespace information to more detailed content not available in the overlay data itself. To share overlays dynamically, they must be published as services. The Overlay Services provide the exchange protocols and business rules required for effective information exchange of battlespace information so that it can be unambiguously rendered by command and control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA) applications, and understood by humans.
