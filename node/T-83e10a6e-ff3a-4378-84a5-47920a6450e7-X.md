title: Enable
description: The "Enable” process area includes those basic business processes that are required to run and manage any large enterprise. These generic processes focus on providing those support services that are required throughout the entire defence enterprise such as Financial Management, Human Resources Management processes, etc.. Since enabling processes are aimed at general support within the defence enterprise, they may interface as needed with almost every other process in the enterprise, be they governance, strategy, force development or operations processes. Most of the common business processes are defined in the “Enable” process area, however, those processes that are specific to the conduct of military operations are defined in the “Operate” process area (e.g. organic Tactical CIS Support, planning and providing Health Services Support (HSS) for combat operations).
