title: Platform Guard Services
description: The Platform Guard Services provide the means to connect networks of different information security and management policies and usage areas to control traffic flow in-between the networks following a set of predefined rules for platform services. The intended function is to allow automated data exchange between two network enclaves that belong to different information domains. The services enable a cross-domain information exchange by mediating traffic flows, while offering sufficient protection against the unintended leakage of confidential information and possible degradation of integrity of resources by enforcing an appropriate access control policy.
