title: Risk Management Processes
description: The processes for Risk Management (RM) describe the activities to manage an organization's risks by identification, analysis and then evaluation whether those risks should be modified by mitigating actions in order to satisfy their risk criteria. Throughout these processes organizations communicate and consult with stakeholders and monitor and review the risk and the controls that are modifying the risk in order to ensure that no further risk mitigation is required. Key enabling processes related to Risk Management are the [[Risk Management Governance Processes]], whereby an organization conducts processes that Risk Management is appropriately integrated across all areas of Business or Operations.
