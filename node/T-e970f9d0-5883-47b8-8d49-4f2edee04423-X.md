title: Capability Development Initiation Processes
description: The processes for Capability Development Initiation are the first phase in the Capability Development processes. The main objectives are to help define the scope and benefit expectations and to ensure that authorization and initiation of Capability Development are linked to the organization's ongoing work and strategic priorities. The initiation phase lays the foundation for Capability Development in five distinct ways  # Establish High-level Capability Requirements -- these specify general capabilities. Less emphasis is placed on minor requirements (the over-specification of which often leads to cost overruns and delays); rather, minor requirements are deferred to future phases or increments. # Perform Initial Market Surveys and Capability Reviews -- these are conducted in order to identify potential solutions or solution components and establish a successful capability development strategy. # Initiate Capability Architecture Development -- this is developed to commence initial systems engineering activities. # Establish Capability Development Strategy -- the previous three steps are used to establish the overall capability development strategy and procurement approach for materials and services. # Authorize Capability Development Programme -- once the strategy is established, the programme is authorized, and the programme- and portfolio-level governance and management organizations are established.
