title: Capability Development Processes
description: The processes for (military) Capability Development describe the activities to provide a solution space that considers solutions involving a combination of doctrine, organization, training, materiel and technology, leadership and education, personnel, facilities and interoperability (DOTMLPF-I) required to accomplish designated (future) missions or achieve a desired effect in specified operating environments. The context within which the military capabilities are used such as the geography of the area of operations, the culture and demography of the enemy, and the preparedness of the opposing forces are general planning assumptions for capability development activities. Capability Development also encompasses maintaining military capability, e.g through continual modernisation of employed military technologies. DOTMLPF-I also serves as a mnemonic for staff planners to consider all issues (also known as  Lines of Development) during a capability development effort. * Doctrine -- the way military forces fight, e.g., emphasizing maneuver warfare combined air-ground campaigns. * Organization -- how they organize to fight; Joint Task Forces, divisions, brigades, air wings, Maritime Task Forces, Carrier Battle Groups (CVBG), etc. * Training -- how they prepare to fight tactically; basic training to advanced individual training, various types of unit training, joint exercises, etc. * Materiel -- what is necessary to properly equip military forces; this includes, weapons, spares, C2 and communications systems, technology solutions etc. so that military forces can operate effectively. * Leadership and education -- how they prepare military leaders -across all levels - to lead the fight; individual professional development needs. * Personnel -- availability of qualified people for peacetime, wartime, and various contingency operations * Facilities -- real property; installations and industrial facilities (e.g. government owned ammunition production facilities) that support military forces. * Interoperability -- what is needed to enable forces, systems and personnel to be able to act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve tactical, operational and strategic objectives. Interoperability concerns all seven lines of development (DOTMLPF) mentioned above and includes internal interoperability within national military forces (e.g joint interoperability) as well as external interoperability with other military forces (e.g. allies or potential coalition partners). In terms of technologies, weapons and equipment use, it represents assets, that exist to perform specific functions in relation to requirements of present or future military operations as derived from the national defence policy through defence planning. A national defence or Capabilities Development plan seeks to provide a global understanding of capability needs, capability trends and potential capability shortfalls.
