title: Military Engineering Processes
description: The processes for Military Engineering (MILENG) describe the engineer activities undertaken regardless of component or service to shape the physical operating environment. Military engineering provides commanders with the means to use terrain in a manner that best meets campaign and operationsâ€™ objectives by applying a range of skills such as field, construction, environmental and geospatial engineering. In applying these skills, all joint functions at all levels of operations are supported . Specialist areas of expertise are environmental protection (EP), infrastructure development, and geospatial engineering support. Significant support is also provided to Countering-Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED), utility production, route clearance, camp sustainment, post-construction monitoring and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).
