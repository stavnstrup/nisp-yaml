title: Cyberspace Operations
description: The Cyberspace Operations Processes describe activities required for planning, preparing, command and control operations and exercises in and through Cyberspace. Cyberspace operations are likely to be an integral part of military operations and missions and need to be considered from the early stages of planning. The commander should, to the maximum extent possible, deconflict, synchronise, and coordinate Cyberspace activities in all domains to obtain the desired effects.
