title: Link Switching Services
description: The Link Switching Services provide static switching and forwarding of different fractional channels or full digital trunk lines over an established (e.g. dialed-up) dedicated communications channel (circuit). The communications channel functions as if the nodes were physically connected and guarantees the full bandwidth of the channel for the duration of the communication session. The following service types can be considered as being associated with link-switching protocols  * Slot-based switching -- Switching different time slots within a TDMA carrier to different nodes in a TDMA network (wireless, satcom), for transmission or reception. Considered protocols, also serving a time-domain multiple access purpose, are multi-frequency Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and selective TDMA. * Frequency-based (or wavelength-based) switching services -- Switching different frequencies (or wavelengths) within a given frequency range, to different nodes in a FDMA network (wireless, satcom) for transmission or reception. Considered protocols are Single-Carrier Frequency-Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) or Wavelength Division Multiple Access (WDMA). * Code-based switching services -- Switching different codes within a given family of pseudo-random codes, modulating RF carriers, to different nodes in a Code-division Multiple Access network (wireless, satcom) for transmission or reception. Considered protocols are W-CDMA, TD-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, DS-CDMA, FH-CDMA, OFHMA and MC-CDMA. * Channel switching services -- Switching RF carriers to channels/sub-channels on different transponders, coverage areas, for transmission or reception (applies to satellite communications only).
