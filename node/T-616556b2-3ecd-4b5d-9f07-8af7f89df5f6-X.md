title: Quality Management Processes
description: The processes for Quality Management describe the activities to ensures that an organization, product or service is consistent on the basis of four sub-processes  quality planning, quality assurance, quality control and quality improvement. Quality management is focused not only on output quality, but also on the means to achieve it. Quality management, therefore, uses quality assurance and control of processes as well as outputs to achieve more consistent quality. Quality can be defined as fitness for intended use or, in other words, how well the product performs its intended function.
