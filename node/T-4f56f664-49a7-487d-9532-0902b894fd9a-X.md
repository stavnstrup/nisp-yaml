title: Container Services
description: The Container Services enable logical executable units of software through which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently on different IT platforms and environments (e.g. desktop, laptop, data center or cloud). Containerization provides a clean separation between the development of applications with their logic, libraries and dependencies, and the deployment that is focused on the management of service quality, workload and scale.
