title: Provide Policy and Military Advice
description: As changes to the strategic environment become apparent to the organisation's governing council through the [[Maintain Strategic Situational Awareness]] process, they will task appropriate policy planning committees to generate advice on specific issues and threats. These policy planning committees will then instigate programmes of work to develop suitable responses and recommendations for endorsement by the organisation's governing council.
