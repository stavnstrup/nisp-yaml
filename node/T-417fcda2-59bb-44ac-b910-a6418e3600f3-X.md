title: Establish Facility Management Processes
description: A key function of the Facilities Management function is the establishment of policies and processes to ensure effective and efficient use of the workplace. Examples include  * Submitting a work order request * Reserving space within the facility * Checking in guests and visitors * Emergency action planning Facility managers serve the dual role of identifying governance areas and adapting processes to cover them. Whenever a new situation arises, it is up to the facility manager to create and deploy a repeatable framework for handling enduring scenarios in the future. Developing processes is also where the scope of facility management expands its reach. New processes may involve different departments, employees, assets, fixtures, and spacesâ€”all of which connect the many aspects of the business.
