title: Peacemaking (PM)
description: The Peacemaking (PM) mission type consists of diplomatic-led activities aimed at establishing a cease-fire or a rapid peaceful settlement and is conducted after a conflict has started. Through comprehensive approaches the activities can include the provision of good offices, mediation, conciliation, and such actions as diplomatic pressure, isolation, sanctions, or other activities. Peacemaking is accomplished primarily by diplomatic means; however, military support to peacemaking can be made either indirectly, through the threat of intervention, or in the form of direct involvement of military assets.
