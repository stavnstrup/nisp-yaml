description: The Recognized Cyber Picture (RCP) Services provide means to produce, manage and disseminate the correlated and fused cyber picture, providing enhanced situational awareness of the cyber domain, including on-going activities and their relationships. The Recognized Cyber Picture Services provide a near-real-time representation of all-source cyber data (current and planned). There are basically three main components contributing to Cyber Situational Awareness  # Status of the own or friendly cyber terrain (own CIS), this is supported by the RCISP # Intelligence regarding adversaries, vulnerabilities, intent etc., this is supported by the RIP # Cyberspace information of specific interest to the mission. While many elements of cyberspace can be mapped geographically, a full understanding of an adversaryâ€™s disposition and capabilities in cyberspace involves understanding the target, not only at the underlying physical network layer but also at the logical network layer and cyber-persona layer, including profiles of system users and administrators and their relationship to adversary critical factors.
