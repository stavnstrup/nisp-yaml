title: Configuration Management Database Services
description: The Configuration Management Database (CMDB) Services provide access to a repository that is designed to store many of the components of an information system. A CMDB contains data describing managed resources like computer systems and application software and/or process artefacts like incident, problem and change records, and the relationships among these entities. In the context of ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), a CMDB represents the authorized configuration of the significant components of the IT environment. A key goal of CMDB is to help an organization understand the relationships between different components and track their configuration. The CMDB is a fundamental component of the ITIL framework's Configuration Management process. CMDB implementations may integrate with change management, knowledge management and/or authorization.
