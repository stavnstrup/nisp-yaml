title: Missions and Operations
description: The "Missions and Operations" layer in the C3 Taxonomy represents NATO's political and military ambitions as derived from the Strategic Concept and Political Guidance. These ambitions are expressed in a series of possible Mission Types and related Key Tasks, as well as references to relevant concepts, guidance, policies and publications. The Mission Types are identified in policy and guidance, and subsequently, the Key Tasks are derived though the Mission-to-Task Decomposition (MTD), as expressed in the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP).
