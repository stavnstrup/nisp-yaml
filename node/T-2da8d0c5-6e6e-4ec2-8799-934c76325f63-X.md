title: Plan Military Campaign
description: The Campaign Plan Development Process encompasses two sub-phases  # Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Development -- in developing an appropriate CONOPS, the assigned strategic military commander will establish the overall design and structure for military operations, in concert with other coalition and non-military efforts. The strategic-level CONOPS, as approved by the political level should demonstrate how to achieve the strategic objectives and conditions required to attain the desired end state. An illustrative combined joint statement of requirements (CJSOR) and (if possible) an illustrative strategic statement of requirements (SoR) will be submitted with the CONOPS for information. # Plan and develop a strategic SoR including force generation -- this second step should identify and activate forces and capabilities required to accomplish the mission with acceptable risks. Generally, the relevant political areas will draft their advice to the government. The [[Chief of Defence (term)|Chief of Defence (CHOD)]] advice will include the endorsement of the Strategic CONOPS, and subsequently the Strategic OPLAN, as well as the supporting strategic SoR and rule-of-engagement request. This CHOD advice and the Strategic Commanderâ€™s products are provided to Government which, has all inputs fused into a consolidated set of political military recommendations, possibly in the form of a strategic political-military plan, on which basis a mission may be executed. After political approval of the OPLAN, with its related strategic SoR and set of Rules of Engagement, the Government typically issues an execution directive in case the initiation of the military campaign was desired.
