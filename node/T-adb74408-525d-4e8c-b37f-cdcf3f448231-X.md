title: Virtualized Networking Services
description: The Virtualized Networking Services Network virtualization allow IT managers to consolidate multiple physical networks, divide a network into multiple segments or create software-only networks between virtual machines (VMs). The goal of network virtualization is to improve the agility to direct appropriate network resources to VMs in data center environments and the ability to consolidate or segment networks. Virtual networks can be created in two ways -- inside or outside the server. External software uses switches, adapters and the network to aggregate physical local area networks (LANs) into a single logical LAN, or to break a physical LAN into multiple virtual LANs (VLANs). Internal software allows virtual machines (VMs) to exchange data on a host without an external network.
