title: Communications Services
description: The Communications Services interconnect systems and mechanisms for the opaque transfer of selected data between or among access points, in accordance with agreed quality parameters and without change in the form or content of the data as sent and received. The taxonomy of Communications Services takes a generic approach, listing elementary (vice complex) communications services, as building blocks of complex, end-to-end communications services. The granularity of the services described in this taxonomy is such that even the lowest level communications service, e.g. a user typing short free-text messages on a keypad and transmitting them over a UHF satcom DAMA radio, can be represented. The required granularity is achieved by defining elementary service blocks. These are building blocks in complex end-to-end services, as those formulated in the NSOVs of the relevant reference architectures and derived target architectures. Elementary service blocks are agnostic to the resources and solutions that service providers can adopt to implement them and can be implemented over different communications segments (terrestrial, radio, satcom), by different service providers. By concatenating these elementary services as building blocks, service architects can streamline and specify any complex communications service, end-to-end (e.g. DCIS service). In particular  * Service blocks are concatenated to follow the flow of information, in a way similar to the actual communications infrastructure that is physically supporting the services. That makes the resulting Comms Service Maps understandable by network architects, service managers, and service providers. Comms Service Maps can be exported and used for a variety of purposes, from service level specification, to service management and control. * Comms maps are two-dimensional representations of a complex communications service. Each service block along the chain can be assigned to different service providers, and clear interface and service delivery or service peering boundaries can be defined between them. * Service providers can select and involve the resources and the technical solutions that best meet the service level specifications for each block, under the constraints posed by the operational context, and by the connectivity/interaction with adjacent service blocks (implemented by other service providers). These constraints shall be reflected in the service level specification. * In the NATO context, service providers can be NATO organic providersproviders (e.g. NCI Agency, e.g. providing Access Services), a NATO Nation or a consortium/group of nations (e.g. providing Transport Services and Transmission Services over military-controlled communications infrastructure), as well as commercial providers (e.g. providing Transmission Services over commercial infrastructure).
