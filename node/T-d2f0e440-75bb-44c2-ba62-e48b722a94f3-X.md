title: Time Zone Data Distribution Services
description: Time Zone Data Distribution Services allow reliable, secure, and fast delivery of time zone data and leap-second rules to client systems such as calendaring and scheduling applications or operating systems. These services provide data for the set of time zones known to servers and expected to be used by clients. This is a key service to ensure server-to-server and client-to-server content interoperability. If such a service is not available, all participants would need to agree up front to configure their systems with a common timezone reference datasource, e.g. https //www.iana.org/time-zones.
