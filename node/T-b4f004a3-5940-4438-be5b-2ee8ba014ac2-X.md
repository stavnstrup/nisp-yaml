title: Network Access Control Services
description: The Network Access Control Services manage the ability of a device to connect to a network based on endpoint security compliance (such as OS patch level, antivirus updates, host IP addresses, etc.) user and system authentication and network security enforcement. The Network Access Control Services will protect a network by preventing non-compliant devices from accessing the network at the IP-level. In case of non-compliance a remote user will be redirected to a network quarantine segment where the client can be updated to the level of required compliance.
