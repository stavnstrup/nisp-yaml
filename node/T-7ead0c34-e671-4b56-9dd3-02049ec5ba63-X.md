title: Support of Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO)
description: The Support of Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEOs) mission type consists of activities from national diplomatic initiatives, with Alliance forces participating in a supporting role. NEOs may be described as operations conducted to relocate (to a place of safety) nocombatants threatened in a foreign country. Normally, Alliance forces would only support a NEO in the framework of a NATO-led operation and that support would not include the evacuation of nationals, which remains a national responsibility; however,nations could conduct NEOs for their nationals on a bi- or multi-national basis using NATO doctrine. Generally, a force committed to a NEO should have the capability to provide security, reception and control, movement, and emergency medical support for the civilians and unarmed military personnel to be evacuated.
