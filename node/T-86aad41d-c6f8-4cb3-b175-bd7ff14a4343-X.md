title: CBRN Applications
description: The Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Applications enable users to collect, process, present and distribute information that supports the major functions of CBRN Defence operations. CBRN Defence is the set of military activities that are conducted by forces to protect the NATO populations, territory or forces against attacks with CBRN weapons or agents, and to minimize the effects of these attacks. CBRN Applications provide decisions makers with accurately display of the CBRN environment in order to execute a comprehensive threat and risk analysis, which include information on own forces' CBRN capabilities and information on hostile capabilities and threats, allowing the creation of CBRN estimates and the CBRN annex to the operational plan.
