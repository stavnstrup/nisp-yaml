title: Architecting Processes
description: The processes for Architecting support the development of architectures for many purposes, and their development can be described as both a process and a discipline. Architecting is a practice for conducting enterprise analysis, design, planning, and implementation, using a holistic engineering approach at all times, for the implementation of strategy. Architecting applies principles and practices to guide organizations through the business/mission, information, application and technology changes necessary to implement their strategies and to develop capabilities that deliver solutions that can meet an organizationâ€™s needs to achieve its mission.
