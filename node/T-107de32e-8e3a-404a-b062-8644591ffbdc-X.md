title: Personnel Recovery Processes
description: The processes for Personnel Recovery (PR) describe the activities to recover and reintegrate personnel who have become isolated or captured. Most PR activities extend across component and national lines of responsibility. The availability of recovery assets determines the potential for successfully recovering isolated personnel. No single force, recovery system or organization is suitable for all situations and may require a mix of conventional, unconventional and non-conventional recovery systems. Operational flexibility and multi-system redundancy, along with robust command and control are the primary factors in successful recovery operations. The isolation, capture and/or exploitation of alliance personnel during operations may have a signiÔ¨Åcant negative impact on operational security, morale of assigned forces and public support. In addition, operations may rely on interaction with agencies or other non-alliance actors for which the alliance may have a responsibility.
