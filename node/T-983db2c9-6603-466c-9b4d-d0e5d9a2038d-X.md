title: Analyze Mission
description: Analysis is a key stage because the information gained in this stage will shape the following planning activities. In this stage, [[Operational Environment Research|research of the Operational Environment]] is conducted to gather as much information and data relevant to accomplishing the mission and any external or internal issues that can affect the mission and objectives are examined and planning premises are established. Premises are planning assumptions about the environment in which the plan is to be carried out. Premises encompass the expected environment of plans in execution. Important premises include- (a) forecasts, (b) basic policies and (c) existing plans. Planners must establish, circulate, and obtain consent to utilize critical planning premises. Identified strengths and weaknesses of an organization as well as any threats and opportunities that may arise must be recorded. Premises must be limited to assumptions that are critical to the mission and its plan. Throughout the planning process, premises must be monitored and updated. Planners use these premises to evaluate future events, and to develop 'action statements' and alternative course of action (COA).
