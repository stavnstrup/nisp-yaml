description: The Block-Level Storage Services provide access to physical and/or virtual storage devices that manage their available space as a sequence of fixed size data blocks. Consumers of Block-Level Storage Services are responsible for giving meaning to each of the blocks and often file systems or relational databases are used to abstract block-level storage.
