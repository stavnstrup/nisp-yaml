title: Logistic Support Processes
description: The processes for Logistic Support describe a range of logistic solutions. These solutions must strike a balance between expeditionary agility and adequate sustainment and take advantage of multinational, host nation (HN) and commercial support solutions as early as possible. The Logistic Support solutions will include an increasing reliance on the reverse supply chain to return unserviceable or surplus items from the JOA for repair and restocking of the strategic base inventory.
