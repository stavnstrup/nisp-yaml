title: Recognized Medical Picture Services
description: The Recognized Medical Picture (RMedP) Services provide the means to create, manage and disseminate the Recognised Medical Picture. Medical decision-making is dependent on the efficient, speedy processing of environmental, tactical, and casualty data. Such information is of fundamental importance in specialties such as epidemiology to enable early detection of disease outbreaks including the use of biological warfare agents (disease surveillance). RMedP services will generate a de-conflicted and agreed picture of the medical environment through the collection, aggregation, correlation and fusion of information from multiple sources.
