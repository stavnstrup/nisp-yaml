title: Information Access Services
description: The Information Access Services transform information stores or sources into web enabled services. Information Access Services provide a generic capability that can be configured as required to expose new information stores or sources in the required service protocols and formats. The intent is to minimize custom services and allow agile provisioning of new capabilities based on evolving operational requirements. By focusing on providing access to information from existing stores and sources, rather than on providing applications which use that information, Information Access Services de-couple the access to information from the use of the information. Since applications can use information in any number of ways to support any number of use cases, de-coupling the access to information from its use reduces the complexity and the combinations of interfaces which must be supported.
