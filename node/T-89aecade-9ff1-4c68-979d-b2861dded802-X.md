title: Reflection Phase
description: A series of seminars hosted by individual allies takes place in order to enhance the strategic debate. The seminars engage all stakeholders and relevant players and partners as appropriate. Seminars cover specific aspects of a Strategic Concept. One seminar will look at the alliance’s core tasks and functions. Another seminar will look at the alliance as a part of a network of security actors in contributing to global civil and military crisis management, and the alliance’s likely tasks with a view to enhancing cooperation with international organisations and NGOs. A third seminar will look at the alliance security environment. A fourth seminar will look at capabilities, including planning and transformation. It will also look at procurement planning, a task that requires flexibility and prioritisation. Groups of experts will also explore other relevant topics, as appropriate.
