title: Link-based Aggregation Services
description: The Link-based (multiple access) Aggregation Services involve the termination of FDMA links (traffic flows transported over carriers at different frequencies), TDMA links (traffic flows transported over time slots of the same or multiple carriers) or CDMA links (traffic flows transported over the same or multiple carriers, using different spreading codes), or variants of these protocols involving one node (hub) acting as concentrator either by stacking multiple modems, or by implementing an integrated multi-modem assembly.
