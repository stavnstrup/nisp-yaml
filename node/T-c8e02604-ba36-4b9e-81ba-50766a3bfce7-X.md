title: Geospatial Terrain Analysis Services
description: The Geospatial Terrain Analysis Services support planning and predictive decision tools by providing information and knowledge products that capture integrated terrain and weather effects. Terrain and weather effects represent a fundamental, enabling piece of battlefield information supporting situation awareness and the decision-making processes within Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR). These effects can both enhance or constrain force tactics and behaviors, platform performance (ground and air), system performance (e.g. sensors) and the soldier.
