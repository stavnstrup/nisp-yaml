title: Protocol Transformation Services
description: The Protocol Transformation Services mediate between communication parties by adjusting the way in which data is exchanged between both parties. Protocol Transformation Services enable the use of different protocols for handling information between information providers and consumers over a possibly heterogeneous network. Protocol Transformation Services are important when different types of communication patterns are being used (e.g. static, deployable or mobile) that would require special protocols to ensure that the information is being transferred in the most efficient possible way. Protocol transformation services mediate between various transport protocols, which for example in a web services setting usually comprise single protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, TLS, SMTP and FTP, but also entire message-oriented middle-ware solutions like IBM's WebSphere MQ or JMS. We speak of protocol virtualization if a protocol mediation services actually offers to consume a service over a range of different transport protocols.
