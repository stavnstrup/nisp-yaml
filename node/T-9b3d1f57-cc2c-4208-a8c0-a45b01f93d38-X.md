title: Geospatial Web Coverage Services
description: The Geospatial Web Coverage Services support requests for geographical coverages across the web using platform-independent calls. The coverages are objects (or images) in a geographical area, whereas the WMS interface or online mapping portals like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially analyze.
