title: Doctrine Development Processes
description: The processes for Doctrine Development describe the activities to support the enhancement of the operational effectiveness of military forces by reflection of fundamental principles and best practices, based on extant capabilities and incorporates changes derived from lessons learned during operations, training, exercises, and, when appropriate, validated concepts. Doctrine evolves as military forces adapt to meet new security challenges. As challenges arise, the development process can be used to identify and fill doctrinal voids. Doctrine may also include terms and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). The commonly used terms doctrine and TTPs are interrelated and mutually supportive; yet, each term has its own usage, level of detail, and place in the hierarchy of doctrinal publications. The Doctrine Development constitutes four sub-processes that are aligned with the doctrine life cycle. # Initiation of doctrine development project. # Development of doctrinal publication. # Approval or agreement by relevant stakeholders. # Maintenance of doctrinal publication. The principal target audiences for doctrinal publications are military forces, doctrinal publications may also be used by multinational partners and other stakeholders to better understand the organizations, capabilities, and operating philosophy of military forces.
