title: Refine Plans
description: Bottom-up revising and refining the plan is a key activity of preparation. During preparation, premises and assumptions made during planning may be proven true or false. Intelligence analysis and reconnaissance may confirm or deny Preparation enemy actions or show changed conditions in the area of operations because of shaping operations. The status of friendly forces may change as the situation changes. Rehearsals may identify coordination issues or other problems needing adjusted. In any of these cases, commanders identify the changed conditions, refine their plans, and if necessary request updates to maintain the main plan.
