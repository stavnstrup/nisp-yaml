title: Strategic Direction Processes
description: Modern military theory divides military operations into strategic, operational, and tactical levels. The three levels allow causes and effects of all forms of war and conflict to be better understoodâ€”despite their growing complexity. The boundaries of the levels of military operations tend to blur and do not necessarily correspond to levels of command. Each level is concerned with planning (making strategy), which involves analyzing the situation, estimating friendly and enemy capabilities and limitations, and devising possible courses of action. Like the operational and tactical levels, the strategic level is also concerned with implementing strategy, which must be reevaluated constantly (and usually on the basis of incomplete information) because military operations are dynamic. * The strategic level is usually the concern of the national Command Authorities and the highest military commanders. * The strategic level is that level at which a nation, often as one of a group of nations, determines national and multinational security objectives and guidance and develops and uses national resources to accomplish them. Strategy is the art and science of developing and employing armed forces and other instruments of national power in a synchronized fashion to secure national or multinational objectives. The Ministry of Defence (or equivalent organization) and highest military commanders translate policy into national strategic military objectives. These national strategic objectives facilitate theater strategic planning. Military strategy, derived from policy, is the basis for all operations. * The strategic level involves a strategic concept, plans for preparing all national instruments of power for war or conflict, practical guidance for preparing the military forces, and leadership of the military forces to achieve strategic objectives.
