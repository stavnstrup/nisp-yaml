title: Standard Implementation
description: Standard Documents alone do not lead to interoperability. Standards need to be implemented in capabilities, e.g. technical interoperability standards must be built into systems and procedural standards must be implemented through actual workflows and trained staff. Often standard implementations fail not because of the specifications, but due to unknown or misaligned incentives. Best practice is to clearly define and document the expected benefits from the very beginning of the standardization activity. Implementing Agreed Organisation Standards as a Matter of Affiliate Policy. Implementation of agreed organisation standards is an affiliate responsibility. Organisation should strongly encourage implementation of ratified standards, by observing, monitoring and reporting results on an affiliate-by-affiliate and case-by-case basis Best practices to facilitate standards implementation  * Convening capability programme managers from different nations make them aware of the appropriate standards * Agreeing implementation timelines for interoperability standards (Otherwise who takes the investment risk to move first?) * Providing support and testing tools for the solution developers to assist in developing standards- based, interoperable solutions. * Working with implementers to collect feedback on the standard for further improvements of the specifications * Certifying solutions against standards * Evaluating the interoperability of different solutions through practical demonstrations and tests (plugfests)
