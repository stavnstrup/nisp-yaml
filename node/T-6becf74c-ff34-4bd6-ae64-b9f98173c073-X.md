title: Transmission Security Services
description: The Transmission Security Services provide Transmission Security (TRANSEC) which is a component of Communications Security (COMSEC). TRANSEC measures are designed to protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than cryptanalysis. TRANSEC aims to achive low probability of interception (LPI); low probability of detection (LPD); and anti-jamming (EPM or ECCM). TRANSEC methods include frequency hopping and spread spectrum where the required pseudorandom sequence generation is controlled by a cryptographic algorithm and key.
