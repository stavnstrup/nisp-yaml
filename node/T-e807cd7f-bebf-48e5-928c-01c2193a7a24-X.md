title: Location Awareness Services
description: The Location Awareness Services provide access to geographic and/or network location data of a device that have been acquired through multiple sources including network carriers, Wi-Fi, IP addresses and landlines. Location data provided through Location Awareness Services can be used to realize greater operational efficiencies, optimize information management and increase security. Location awareness services are typically actively supported by devices using positioning systems, without the active participation of the device "non-cooperative locating" or detection mechanisms can be used. Location Services in the context of networking relates to locating network nodes. These include  * ITU switched line access addressing according to International Telecommunications Union Q-Series standards, Telecommunications Signaling System#7 (SS7) and mirroring ANSI Standards T1.110â€”General Information and subsequent standards. * IEEE media access addressing according to MAC International standard ISO/IEC 10038 with ISO/IEC 11802 and ANSI/IEEE edition. * ISO procedure call addressing according to URN/UUID International standards ISO/IEC 11578 and ISO/IEC 9834 and IETF RFC 4122. Location Services in the context of geography relates to coordinates and altitude/elevation that are either relative to either a standardized system of coordinates, e.g. WGS84, or a fixed object such as a building plan. * Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as the United States' GPS or the European Union's Galileo use satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation). * Indoor positioning systems (IPS) are systems that can locate devices inside a building using lights, radio waves, magnetic fields, acoustic signals, or other sensory information. There are several commercial systems on the market, but there are no agreed standard for IPS systems. Indoor positioning systems use different technologies, including distance measurement to nearby anchor nodes (nodes with known fixed positions, e.g. WiFi / LiFi access points or Bluetooth beacons), magnetic positioning, dead reckoning.
