title: Wireless LOS Static Transmission Services
description: The Wireless Line of Sight (LOS) Static Transmission Services support the wireless transfer of data amongst two or more static nodes within Line of Sight (LOS) of each other, employing modulated Radio Frequency (RF) carriers in different frequency bands. Selection of frequency bands is based on coverage, capacity, propagation, transceiver attributes, and frequency coordination constraints. In the context of these services, a distinction is made between transmission over an optical/visual LOS path (i.e. free of any form of visual obstruction), and a virtual LOS path (i.e. a straight line through visually obstructing material) - also referred to as Non- or Near- LOS (NLOS). Examples of Wireless Line of Sight (LOS) Static Transmission Services with optical/visual LOS are Direct Line of Sight (DLOS) radio and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio-relay. Services with virtual LOS are often employed in the context of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN), or with other types of LOS wireless communication such as Combat Net Radio (CNR), cellular, etc.
