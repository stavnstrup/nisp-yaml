title: Prioritize Capability Development
description: This process is intrinsically interlinked with the [[Defence Planning]] processes, with the output of the [[Assess Capabilities]] process informing the prioritization of alliance capability development. It is important to recognise affiliate capability priorities may not always align with wider alliance priorities, and managing any divergence is a necessary function of this process.
