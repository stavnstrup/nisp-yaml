title: Develop and Maintain Interoperability
description: Interoperability is the ability to operate together using harmonized standards, doctrines, procedures and equipment. It is essential to the work with multiple partner for achieving common tactical, operational and strategic objectives. Interoperability can occur in various organisational environments. Based on ISO 14258, interoperation occurs between two (or more) entities in one of the following ways  integrated, unified or federated. The federated situation is the most probable scenario for full interoperability because in many situations it is the most efficient (economically feasible) solution to work together with multiple partners.
