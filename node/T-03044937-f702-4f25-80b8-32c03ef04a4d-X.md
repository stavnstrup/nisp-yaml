title: Develop Training Strategy
description: In developing a training strategy, an organisation should take into account a number of principles. * That organisation training events will be balanced and address the full range of potential objectives, from localised business operations to large-scale high-intensity operations. * That, taking resource considerations into account, sufficient training of a high quality and on a broad set of scenarios be organized, and, where mutually beneficial, affordable and agreed, linking of organisation and affiliate training be considered. * That training requirements derived from the organisation’s level of ambition will provide the overarching vision for the Strategic Commander’s direction on Training. * That training objectives should be time bounded, in relation to alliance strategic objectives.
