title: Enforcement of Sanctions and Embargoes (ESE)
description: The Enforcement of Sanctions and Embargoes (ESE) mission type consists of activities to force a nation to obey international law or to conform to a resolution or mandate. Sanctions generally concern the denial of supplies, diplomatic, economic, and other trading privileges, and the freedom of movement of those living in the sanctions area. Sanctions may be imposed against a specific party or in the context of Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operation (NA5CRO), over a wide area embracing all parties. The military objective is to establish a barrier, allowing only non-sanctioned goods to enter or exit. Depending on geography, sanction enforcement normally involves some combination of air, land, and maritime forces. Examples are embargoes, maritime interdiction operations (MIOs), and the enforcement of no-fly zones (NFZs).
