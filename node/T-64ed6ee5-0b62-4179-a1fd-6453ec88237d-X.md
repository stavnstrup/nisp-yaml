title: Assess Crisis
description: The Crisis Assessment Process is essentially descriptive in nature, designed to inform the Goverment and Defence Minister of the particular characteristics of the crisis at hand and identify the range of actual or potential implications to security interests taking into account multi-agency assessments. The highest military commanders will produce a strategic assessment of the situation which will form part of the strategic military advice to the government. The military advice feeds the work of the government and other agencies that have a crisis management responsibility. Together with these other agencies advice on political-military guidance, end state, specific crisis response measures , participation by allied countries, and the level of additional interaction with International Organizations is being developed.. Should the government decide that the situation requires a military response, it will task the Defence Enterprise to develop response options to achieve the agreed strategic objectives and end state.
