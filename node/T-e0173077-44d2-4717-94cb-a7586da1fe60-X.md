title: Wireless BLOS Mobile Narrowband Transmission Services
description: The Wireless Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Mobile Narrowband Transmission Services support the wireless data of amongst two or more nodes, where one or more of the nodes are operating on the move, within Line of Sight (LOS) of each other, employing modulated Radio Frequency (RF) carriers in different frequency bands, and employing narrowband low capacity wireless terminals operating mainly in the VHF, UHF frequency bands and in the HF frequency band using sky wave propagation. Examples of Wireless BLOS Mobile Narrowband Transmission Services are Single and Multichannel VLF and LF ON-Line and On-Line and Off-Line OOK Systems, Single Channel HF Radio Equipment, Slow Hop HF EPM Communications Systems, Tactical Data Exchange (Link11/Link 11B), UHF Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA), Super High Frequency (SHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM), Iridium satellite phone communications, and Inmarsat satellite services, all with the consideration that adequate tracking antennas are employed and the transceivers are adapted for platform motion. An additional example is describing HALE service while employing a UAV mounted VHF-UHF CRP supporting AM/FM Line of Sight, SINCGARS ESIP/FH2, HAVEQUICK I/II, Advanced Narrowband Digital Voice Terminal (ANDVT), MIL-STD-188-181C 56kbps, and SATCOM Integrated Waveform MIL-STD-188-182B/183B.
