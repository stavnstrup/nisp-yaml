title: Assessing
description: Within the decision cycle, assessment is determining the impact of events as they relate to overall mission accomplishment. This is the operations assessment process. Fundamental to operations assessment are judgments about actual progress in designated mission areas as measured against the expected progress in those same mission areas. These judgments allow the commander and the staff to determine where adjustments must be made to operations and serve as a catalyst for planning. Ultimately, operations assessment allows the commander and staff to keep pace with a constantly evolving situation while staying focused on mission accomplishment.
