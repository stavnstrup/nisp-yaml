title: Communications Access SMC Services
description: The Communications Access Service Management and Control (SMC) Services provide the necessary means to implement and enforce SMC policies at the communications level. The Communications Access SMC Services are based on the TM Forum Business Process Framework (eTOM) process area Operations and specifically Resource Management & Operations. Within the context of SMC for all Communications Services, the functions and subsequent requirements on each the three layers - Communications Access Services, Transport Services and Transmission Services - experience a great overlap and high level of similarity. Therefore all SMC Services for these layers are defined under [[Communications Access SMC Services]], while they are valid for the other two layers just the same.
