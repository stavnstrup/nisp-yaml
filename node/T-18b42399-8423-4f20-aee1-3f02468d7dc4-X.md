title: Emulated Frame-based Access Services
description: The Emulated Frame-based Access Services provide the delivery or exchange of frames over higher layer protocols (e.g. pseudo-wires). The adaptation of the frame layer to the higher layer protocol is performed within the access device. Frame-based protocols (e.g. Ethernet, PPP, PPPoE) and the underlying protocols supporting the emulation, define the various Service Types within this Service Class (e.g. Ethernet over IP/MPLS).
