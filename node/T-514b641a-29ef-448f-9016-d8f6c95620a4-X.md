title: Teleconsultation Services
description: The Teleconsultation Services support provisioning of clinical health care from a distance, by facilitating the provisioning of offsite specialist medical advice and services (e.g., dental, mental health, cardiology, dermatology) and provides mechanism for exchange of medical specialty-specific data sets (e.g., heart and lung sounds, electrocardiograms, video and still images and electronic health records) between referring physician and remote specialists. Teleconsultation Services supplement common collaboration and communications services such as VTC, chat and email. Teleconsultation Services can be used in critical care and emergency situations when specialist medical healthcare is not available on-site.
