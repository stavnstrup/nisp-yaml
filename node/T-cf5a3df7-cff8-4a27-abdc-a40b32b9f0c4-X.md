title: Wireless LOS Mobile Narrowband Transmission Services
description: The Wireless Line of Sight (LOS) Mobile Narrowband Transmission Services support the wireless data of amongst two or more nodes, where one or more of the nodes are operating on the move, within Line of Sight (LOS) of each other, employing modulated Radio Frequency (RF) carriers in different frequency bands, and employing narrowband low capacity wireless terminals operating mainly in the VHF, UHF frequency bands and in the HF frequency band using direct or ground wave propagation. Examples of Wireless LOS Mobile Narrowband Transmission Services are Single Channel HF/VHF/UHF Radio Equipment, Slow Hop HF EPM Communications Systems, Tactical Data Exchange (Link11/Link 11B), and Future NATO Narrowband Waveform (NBWF), all with the consideration that adequate tracking antennas are employed and the transceivers are adapted for platform motion. Additional service types are Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), Militarized Cellular Networks, Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), and Narrowband HF/VHF Subnet Relay.
