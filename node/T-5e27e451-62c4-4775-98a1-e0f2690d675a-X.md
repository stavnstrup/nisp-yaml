title: Transition and Campaign Termination
description: The Transition and Termination Process supports the transition and eventual OPLAN cancellation, once the review process starts to indicate achievement of the end state and the possibility to draw down and/or handover a mission. The transition has to be based on sound assessments and a mutual synchronisation and consultation process with all relevant players in pursuit of a comprehensive approach, particularly when stabilization and reconstruction activities are involved. The procedural handling of strategic military advice for the transition withdrawal and hand-over to an appropriate authority will follow the pattern of the normal operations planning process (OPP).
