title: Strategic Concept
description: The Strategic Concept is an official document that outlines NATO’s enduring purpose and nature and its fundamental security tasks. It also identifies the central features of the new security environment, specifies the elements of the Alliance’s approach to security and provides guidelines for the adaptation of its military forces. The concept that was adopted by NATO leaders at the 2010 Lisbon Summit, will serve as the Alliance's roadmap for the next ten years. It reconfirms the commitment to defend one another against attack as the bedrock of Euro-Atlantic security.
