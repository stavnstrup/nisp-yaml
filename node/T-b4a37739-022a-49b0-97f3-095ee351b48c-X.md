title: Defence Planning Processes
description: Defence and security planning outlines specific changes (development/reform/transformation) required in response to the needs of, threats to, and vision and objectives for national defence, articulated in the national security and defence policies/strategies. Security and defence planning, particularly long-term defence planning defines the means, including the future force structure, which would allow defence and security sector institutions to deal effectively with likely future challenges. Security sector and defence planning is an integral component in support of security and defence policymaking. Security and Defence Planning encompasses the planning of armaments, logistics, command, control, communications, resources, civil-military emergencies, and in some cases, nuclear planning. Security and Defence Planning is done in the framework of governance processes that address security and defence policies and national security objectives. Security and Defence Planning represents the process via which security objectives translate into security and defence capabilities.
