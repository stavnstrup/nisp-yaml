title: Cyberspace Operations Planning Services
description: The Cyberspace Operations Planning Services provide unique computing and information services for integrating cyberspace aspects into the strategic and operational planning process, addressing the Commanderâ€™s need to maintain Command and Control (C2) of the operation and ensure that effects delivered in or through different domains are orchestrated. By themselves, these services are not unique to cyberspace. Rather, by recognizing cyberspace as a domain, cyber should be fully integrated into existing processes and operations planning services.
