title: Medical Intelligence
description: One of the essential requirements of medical support in the decision making process is the availability of reliable, timely, specific and applicable medical intelligence, from the initial planning stage throughout the operation as well as during and after deployment. Such intelligence will include assessment of hazards of operational concern such as infectious diseases, environmental and industrial health issues, other public health events, and CBRN threats, as well as assessment of host nation and opponent medical capabilities. Medical Intelligence will support the chain of command with qualified intelligence preparation of the battle space, giving input to the overall force protection concept.
