title: Intelligence Processes
description: The processes for Intelligence operations describe the activities necessary to achieve the operational requirements for Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) and deliver Intelligence products in support of operational decison-making and situational awareness. The complexity of modern operations produces a greater need for all-encompassing intelligence, which uses a wide range of sources and agencies to develop understanding of the operational environment. This relies upon geospatial, cultural and linguistic capabilities for information collection and the subsequent processing into intelligence and dissemination.
