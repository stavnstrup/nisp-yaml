title: Support the Workforce
description: The foremost objective of a facility manager is creating an accommodating work environment for employees. This serves many broader goals, including attracting and retaining top talent, improving efficiency and productivity, and creating a positive workplace culture. Facility managers provide employee support in many ways, including  * Coordinating desking arrangements * Managing employee directories * Facilitating moves and space utilization * Handling emergency planning Facility managers serve as a bridge between the workplace and the employees working within it. Whenever issues of accommodation, safety, or comfort arise, it is up to the facility manager to solve them. This applies upward, as well. Facility managers are responsible for providing vital planning data to the executive leadership and determining the long-term approach to workplace optimization. Their everyday interaction with the workplace sheds light on true costs and competitive advantages at the employee level.
