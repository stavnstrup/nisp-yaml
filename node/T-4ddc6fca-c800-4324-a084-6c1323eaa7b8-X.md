title: Indications and Warning
description: Indications and Warning (I&W) refers to the monitoring of defined indicators and the provision of warnings to relevant authorities in case of changes in indicators to support effective decision making. These intelligence activities are intended to facilitate the detection and reporting of intelligence information regarding developments that could involve a threat to national security. The I&W processes provide long term crisis anticipation and assessment of the level of potential threats to the government. Identifying potential threats is the first line of defence and deterrence therefore it is imperative to provide strategic early warning for national security authorities.
