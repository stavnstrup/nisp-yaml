title: Model Repository Services
description: The Model Repository Services provides the means to store, retrieve and manage models used for simulation purposes. The Model Repository Services supports all models required for simulation, independent of type and purpose. Each model has well-defined parameters, including  inputs, outputs, rules, behaviours and constraints. Each model has associated metadata detailing its provenance, problem domain, and information and parameter requirements. Through Model Repository Services, authoritative models can be discovered, including their metadata, and retrieved for execution.
