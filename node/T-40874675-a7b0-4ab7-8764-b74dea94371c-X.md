title: Message Routing Services
description: The Message Routing Services are services that can dynamically route messages at run time based on different criteria, e.g. message content or metadata or for load-balancing purposes. The routing logic shall be configurable. The Message Routing Services can be also used to provide one-to-many message delivery by multiplying a message and sending it to many recipients, e.g. this can be used to implement multicast messages.
