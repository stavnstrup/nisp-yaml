description: The Tactical Interoperability Network Interconnection Profile provides standards and guidance for a shared interoperability network at the mobile tactical edge  when no common waveform for land tactical radios can be used to interconnect networks, a standard "bridging" solution with loaned radios can be used to mitigate the interoperability problem. In that situation, interoperability will be achieved with the exchange of assets. Information exchange for mobile users at the tactical edge is based on STANAG 4677. The information exchange over the loaned radio interface shall be protected with similar mechanisms that are required to protect NATO RESTRICTED information or an equivalent mission classification level. The protection of information at the lower tactical level has a number of distinctive characteristics  The information is often transient and perishable â€“ it is only relevant for a short period of time.The transmission of information is confined to a small geographic area.The information is held on portable devices which are often close to physical threats.The networks at the lower tactical level are often isolated from the wider network.
