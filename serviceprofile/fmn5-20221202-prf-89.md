    description: The "Minimum Link-16 Message Profile", as described in the FMN Spiral 3 Service Interface Profile for RAP Data, defines the minimum set of data elements that are required to be available for operational or technical reasons so that correctly formatted technical message can be generated to establish the COP in a federated environment. The implementation of the following message types of ATDLP-5.16 is MANDATORY and refers to Appendix A of the standard for the detailed requirement of receive or transmit support, also based on the role of the MNP  Precise Participant Location and Identification (PPLI) MessagesJ2.0 Indirect Interface Unit PPLIJ2.2 Air PPLIJ2.3 Surface (Maritime) PPLIJ2.4 Subsurface (Maritime) PPLIJ2.5 Land (Ground) Point PPLIJ2.6 Land (Ground) Track PPLISurveillance MessagesJ3.0 Reference PointJ3.1 Emergency PointJ3.2 Air Track messageJ3.3 Surface (Maritime) TrackJ3.4 Subsurface (Maritime) TrackJ3.5 Land (Ground) Point/TrackJ3.7 Electronic Warfare Product Information For MNPs that are contributing to Shared Situational Awareness production, the following messages should be supported to maximize the ability to share tactical data  J7 Information ManagementJ9 Weapons Coordination and ManagementJ10 Weapons Coordination and ManagementJ12 ControlJ13 Platform and System StatusJ15 Threat WarningJ17 Miscellaneous More recent editions of this standard may be implemented for operational use but ATDLP-5.16 is the minimum to guarantee Link 16 tactical message distribution.

    description: The JREAP Standard enables TDL data to be transmitted over digital media and networks not originally designed for tactical data exchange. JREAP consists of three different protocols  A, B and C. For implementation in FMN only JREAP-C 'Encapsulation over Internet Protocol (IP)' which enables TDL data to be transmitted over an IP network must be used. Refer to Appendix E of the standard for an overview of which messages are MANDATORY for implementation. Whenever there is a common reference clock in the JREAP network, one that is available to all nodes, it should be used. In instances when there is no reference clock available, then Round Trip Time (RTT) should be utilized. With a common time reference, all JREAP-C gateways have a simple way to synchronize and measure delays between JREAP-C nodes by looking at the time of transmission inside the incoming messages. In instances where nodes do not have a common time reference, JREAP-C offers RTT message to measure delays between gateways. These messages measure the RTT between nodes. Each node can state which time reference it will support, and which is its preferred protocol. Inherent within the standard is the ability to select either method
