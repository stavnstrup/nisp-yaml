description: The Web Content Profile provides standards and guidance for the processing, sharing and presentation of web content on federated mission networks. Web presentation services must be based on a fundamental set of basic and widely understood protocols, such as those listed below. Recommendations in the Service Interface Profile (SIP) for Web Applications are intended to improve the experience of Web applications and to make information and services available to users irrespective of their device and Web browser. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in an identical representation across all devices  the context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts. While services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations.
