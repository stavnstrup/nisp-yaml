    description: Implementation of JC3IEDM (STANAG 5525) in the context of the ISR Library Interface Profile is limited to the definition of unique keys that could be used to unambiguously refer to an external information object that is modelled in accordance with JC3IEDM. Note that AEDP-17 refers to the metadata attribute “JC3IEDMIdentifier” on page G-15, but to “identifierJC3IEDM” on page G-79. The correct attribute to use is “identifierJC3IEDM”.
