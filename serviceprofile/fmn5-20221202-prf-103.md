description: The Web Service Messaging Profile (WSMP) defines a set of service profiles to exchange a wide range of XML-based messages. WSMP is extensible and may be used by any Community of Interest (COI). It is based on publicly available standards and defines a generic message exchange profile based on the Request/Response (RR) and the Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) Message Exchange Pattern (MEP). WSMP is platform independent and can be profiled for different wire protocols such as SOAP. Other protocols like REST, JMS, AMQP, and WEBSocket will be profiled later. This profile is intended for software developers to implement interoperable "WSMP services" and "WSMP clients".
