description: A GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information. The GeoPackage standard describes a set of conventions for storing within a SQLite database vector features, tile matrix sets of imagery and raster maps at various scales and extensions. Please note that the spatial extent, vector and raster content, use of extensions, CRS, and metadata of a GeoPackage will generally be based on the intended use and the existing capabilities of system(s) that will use the GeoPackage.
