description: The Text-based Collaboration Managed Chatroom Profile provides standards and guidance to host moderated, password-protected and member-only chatrooms to support strongly controlled persistent near-real time text-based group collaboration capability (chat) for time critical reporting and decision making in military operations. In addition to standard chatroom features such as room topics and invitations, the protocol defines a strong room control model, including the ability to kick and ban users, to name room moderators and administrators, to require membership or passwords in order to join the room, etc.
