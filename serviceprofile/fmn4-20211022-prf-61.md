description: The Inter-Autonomous Systems Routing Profile provides standards and guidance for routing between inter-autonomous systems. The best current practice for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) based network routing operations and security is described in RFC 7454 - "BGP Operations and Security". Deployment guidance with regards to the application of BGP in the Internet is described in IETF RFC 1772 1995.
