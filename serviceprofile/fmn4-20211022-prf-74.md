description: In the context of secure communications, PPK is the Pre-Placed Key, which is a symmetric encryption key, pre-positioned in a cryptographic unit. Note  SCIP is depending on the FIPS 186-2 Digital Signature Standard. This standard is superseded by FIPS 186-4, which is the applicable standard in the Service Instructions for Digital Certificates. FIPS 186-2 is only allowed within the confinement of SCIP-based secure voice solutions on the mission network.
