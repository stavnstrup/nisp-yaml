description: ISO 42030 describes how architecture evaluations are performed for many reasons, including – determining if a system of interest has been or is being architected in such a way that it fulfils its intended purpose, evaluating the architecture’s effectiveness and suitability towards particular needs of stakeholders, identifying risks for mitigation and identifying opportunities for its improvement. Stakeholders involved in architecture governance are often accountable for these and they have a need to conduct or commission recurring architecture evaluations which can be executed in a systematic fashion.
