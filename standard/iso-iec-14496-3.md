  title: "Coding of audio-visual objects â€” Part 3: Audio"
  date: "2009-09"
  version: "Ed 4"
applicability: >2
  ISO/IEC 14496-3 2009 integrates many different types of audio coding  natural sound with synthetic sound, low bitrate delivery with high-quality delivery and lossless coding, speech with music, complex soundtracks with simple ones, and traditional content with interactive and virtual-reality content. By standardizing individually sophisticated coding tools - as well as a novel, flexible framework for audio synchronization, mixing and downloaded post-production - ISO/IEC 14496-3 2009 creates adequate technology for a new, interactive world of digital audio.  ISO/IEC 14496-3 2009, unlike previous audio standards created by ISO/IEC and other groups, does not target a single application such as real-time telephony or high-quality audio compression. Rather, it applies to every application requiring the use of advanced sound compression, synthesis, manipulation or playback. ISO/IEC 14496-3 2009 specifies state-of-the-art coding tools in several domains. As these tools are integrated with the other parts of ISO/IEC 14496, new possibilities for object-based audio coding, interactive presentation, dynamic soundtracks, and other sorts of new media are enabled.

    Since a single set of tools is used to cover the needs of a broad range of applications, interoperability is a natural feature of systems that build on ISO/IEC 14496-3 2009.
