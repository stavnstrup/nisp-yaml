    The MIP4 Information Exchange Specification (MIP4-IES) is the next generation of MIP Specifications, exchanging information using standards-based Web Service patterns, with discrete message sets based on semantics derived from the MIP Information Model (MIM). MIP4-IES is extensible to accommodate the addition of future information exchange requirements without impacting existing capabilities. MIP4-IES is composed of both Exchange Mechanism patterns as well as comprehensive Information Definitions (the message schemas). Supporting products (test utilities, reference implementations, implementation guidance, and mappings to Symbology standards) are published alongside the MIP4-IES core specification, but are considered as guidance artifacts, are also included, in order to facilitate implementation and validation.
