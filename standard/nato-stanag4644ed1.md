  This section presents the specification for the following planning tasks   

  *  definition of the rules, policies and constraints for the implementation of an IP addressing plan for TACOMS; and

  *  definition of the rules, policies and constraints for the implementation of a naming plan for TACOMS.



    In addition, the following functions shall be used in conjunction with the specifications 

    

  *  implementation of multicast addressing mechanisms for those applications that require them; andd

  *  recommendations on the use of AS (Autonomous System) numbers in conjunction with the addressing/naming plans.



    In a TFN, a distinction is made between IP addresses visible to the TFN and IP addresses reserved for internal NE use. The relationship between TFN, NEs, external networks, and TACOMS Phase 1 interfaces is shown in Figure A-1.
