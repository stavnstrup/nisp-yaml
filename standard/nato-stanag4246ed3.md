  The aim of this STANAG is to define the timing characteristics, the radio equipment characteristics and interfaces necessary to ensure interoperability of land, air and maritime single channel UHF radio equipment when HAVE QUICK capability is incorporated.  HAVE QUICK is a frequency hopping, jam-resistant technique for both non-secure and secure voice use with single channel, electronically tunable UHF AM radios as described in STANAG 4205 and as supplemented by the technical characteristics listed in Annexes C and D of this STANAG. There are two versions of this technique  HAVE QUICK I and HAVE QUICK II. The HAVE QUICK I mode is not interoperable with the HAVE QUICK II mode because of the different frequencies and net structures used in each mode. The HAVE QUICK II equipment, however, retains all the frequencies and net structures of HAVE QUICK I, as well as its own, to ensure interoperability.
