  title: "Linear Predictive Coding at 2400 b/s"
  date: "1984-02-13"
  version: "1"
applicability: >2
  Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) is one of the most powerful speech analysis techniques, and one of the most useful methods for encoding good quality speech at a low bit rate. It provides extremely accurate estimates of speech parameters, and is relatively efficient for computation. LPC-10e provides intelligible speech transmission at 2400 bits per second.
