  title: "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"
  date: "2003-01"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  eSMTP defines an extension to the SMTP service, which allows an SMTP client to specify

  *  that delivery status notifications (DSNs) should be generated under certain conditions,

  *  whether such notifications should return the contents of the message, and

  *  additional information, to be returned with a DSN, that allows the sender to identify both the recipient(s) for which the DSN was issued, and the transaction in which the original message was sent.
