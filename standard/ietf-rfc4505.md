  title: "Anonymous Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"
  date: "2006-06"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access to various services. Traditionally, this has been done with a plain- text password mechanism using anonymous as the user name and using optional trace information, such as an email address, as the password. As plain-text login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.
