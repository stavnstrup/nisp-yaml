  title: "7 kHz Audio-Coding within 64 kbit/s"
  date: "2012-09"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  Rec. ITU-T G.722 describes the characteristics of an audio (50 to 7 000 Hz) coding system which may be used for a variety of higher quality speech applications. The coding system uses sub-band adaptive differential pulse code modulation (SB-ADPCM) within a bit rate of 64 kbit/s. The system is henceforth referred to as 64 kbit/s (7 kHz) audio coding. In the SB-ADPCM technique used, the frequency band is split into two sub-bands (higher and lower) and the signals in each sub-band are encoded using ADPCM. The system has three basic modes of operation corresponding to the bit rates used for 7 kHz audio coding  64, 56 and 48 kbit/s. The latter two modes allow an auxiliary data channel of 8 and 16 kbit/s respectively to be provided within the 64 kbit/s by making use of bits from the lower sub-band.
