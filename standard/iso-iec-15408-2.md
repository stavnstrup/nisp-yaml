  ISO/IEC 15408-2 2008 defines the content and presentation of the security functional requirements to be assessed in a security evaluation using ISO/IEC 15408. It contains a comprehensive catalogue of predefined security functional components that will meet most common security needs of the marketplace. These are organized using a hierarchical structure of classes, families and components, and supported by comprehensive user notes.  ISO/IEC 15408-2 2008 also provides guidance on the specification of customized security requirements where no suitable predefined security functional components exist.
