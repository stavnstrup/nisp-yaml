  date: "2002-12"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This document, Transport Mappings for the Simple Network Management Protocol, defines how the management protocol (RFC3416) may be carried over a variety of protocol suites. It is the purpose of this document to define how the SNMP maps onto an initial set of transport domains. At the time of this writing, work was in progress to define an IPv6 mapping, described in (RFC3419). Other mappings may be defined in the future.
