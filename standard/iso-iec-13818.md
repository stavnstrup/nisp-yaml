  Generic Coding of Moving Pictures and Associated Audio is a formal standard defined by ISO 13818. MPEG-2 is required for generic compression coding of moving pictures and associated audio. MPEG-2 systems will form the infrastructure for delivery of audio and video in many industry sectors, including television distribution, visual telecommunications and a host of computer and multimedia applications.  MPEG-2 was initially intended for the recording and transmission of studio-quality motion video at bit rates in the order of 4 to 6 Mbps. The objective of MPEG-2 is to improve the quality of the image while maintaining the bit rate significantly below 10 Mbps. At the same time, more audio capabilities, such as multiple channels, have been included. The initial MPEG-2 standard has also been extended to support several HDTV formats. Its fields of application should be desktop videoconferencing and videophony
