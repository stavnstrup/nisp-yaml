  The T.120 standards cover the document conferencing and application sharing (sometimes called data conferencing) portion of a multimedia teleconference. The recommendations specify how to efficiently and reliably distribute files and graphical information in real-time during a multipoint multimedia meeting. The objective of the T.120 standards is to assure interoperability between terminals without either participant assuming prior knowledge of the other system; permit data sharing among participants in a multimedia teleconference, including white board image sharing, graphic display information, and image exchange, application sharing, and, specify infrastructure protocols for audiographic or audiovisual applications.
