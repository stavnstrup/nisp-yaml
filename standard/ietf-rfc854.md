  title: "Telnet Protocol Specification"
  date: "1983-05"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The purpose of the TELNET Protocol is to provide a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility. Its primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes to each other. It is envisioned that the protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal communication (linking) and process-process communication (distributed computation).
