  This corrigendum corrects three changes necessary to the existing C code (Release 1.1) that is supplied with ITU-T Rec. G.722.1. In each case, it corrects an error that was introduced when the original C code (known as release code3.003 at the time of Determination) was converted to use basic operators. The corrected code will be labelled as Release 1.2.
