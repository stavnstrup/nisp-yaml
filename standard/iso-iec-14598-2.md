  title: "Software product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) - Planning and management"
  date: "2007-02"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  ISO/IEC 25001 2007 provides details about the planning and management requirements associated with software product quality requirements and evaluation.  While it is mainly concerned with product quality requirements and evaluation, wherever it is relevant the corresponding process requirements and evaluation activities are also discussed.

  ISO/IEC 25001 2007 aims to clarify the requirements which should be identified by the organization in order to ensure the success of specifying quality requirements and executing the evaluation.  ISO/IEC 25001 2007 is intended to be used in conjunction with the other parts of the SQuaRE series (ISO/IEC 25000-ISO/IEC 25051) of International Standards, and with ISO/IEC 14598 and ISO/IEC 9126-1 until superseded by the ISO/IEC 25000 series of International Standards.

  ISO/IEC 25001 2007 complies with the technical processes identified in ISO/IEC 15288 related to quality requirements definition and analysis.
