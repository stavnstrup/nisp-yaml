  title: "Profiles for Binding Metadata to a Data Object"

  version: "(A)(1)"
applicability: >2
    The aim of this standard is to respond to the following interoperability requirements 

  

  *  There is a requirement to bind metadata to information to enable trust between sharing partners in a data centric environment. A standardized approach to binding metadata is necessary for common interpretation of binding.

    Therefore, this standard profiles a given set of data-object specifications and the ADatP-4778 to bind metadata to these same data-objects.

    Edition A of this standards holds binding profiles for the following data-object formats (the binding profile chapter titles may be related to the protocols that define the data-objects they ship instead of the actual data-object) 

  

  *  Chapter 3 (SMTP) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

  *  Chapter 4 (XMPP) eXtensible Message and Presence Protocol

  *  Chapter 5 (OOXML) Office Open XML Formats

  *  Chapter 6 (SOAP) Simple Object Access Protocol

  *  Chapter 7 (REST) REpresentational State Transfer

  *  Chapter 8 (OPC) Generic Open Packaging Convention

  *  Chapter 9 Sidecar Files

  *  Chapter 10 (XMP) eXtensible Metadata Platform

  *  Chapter 11 (WSMP) Web Service Messaging Profile

  *  Chapter 12 (XML) Common XML Artefacts

    Additionally, previously cited chapters profile the use of the Cryptographic Artefact Binding Profiles of chapter 2 in order to support security services of integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation on the binding references between the metadata and the data-object.
