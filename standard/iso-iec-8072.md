  *  the primitive actions and events of the service;

  *  the parameter data associated with each primitive action and event;

  *  the relationship between, and the valid sequences of, these actions and events.



    The service defined in this Recommendation | International Standard is that which is provided by all OS1 Transport Protocols (in conjunction with the Network Service) and which may be used by any OS1 Session Protocol.
