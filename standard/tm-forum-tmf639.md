  version: ""
applicability: >2
    The following document is intended to provide details of the REST API interface for Resource Inventory. The intent of this API is to provide a consistent/standardized mechanism to query and manipulate the Resource inventory.

    For example, the Resource Inventory API can be 

  *  used to query the resource instances for a party playing the role of customer via Self Service Portal or the Call Centre operator can query the resource instances on behalf of the customer while a customer may have a complaint or a query.

  *  called by the Resource Order Management to create a new resource instance/ update an existing resource instance in the Resource Inventory.
