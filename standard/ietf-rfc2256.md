  title: "A summary of the X.500(96) User Schema for Use with LDAPv3"
  date: "1997-12"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object classes defined by the ISO and ITU-T committees in the X.500 documents, in particular those intended for use by directory clients. This is the most widely used schema for LDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema definitions for white pages objects use it as a basis. This document does not cover attributes used for the administration of X.500 directory servers, nor does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.
