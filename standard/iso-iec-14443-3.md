  date: "2011-04"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This part of ISO/IEC 14443 describes   

  *  polling for PICCs entering the field of a PCD

  *  the byte format, the frames and timing used during the initial phase of communication between proximity coupling devices (PCDs) and proximity integrated circuit(s) cards (PICCs)

  *  the initial REQ and ATQ command content

  *  methods to detect and communicate with one card among several cards (anticollision)

  *  other parameters required to initialize communications between a proximity card and a proximity coupling device

  *  optional means to ease and speed up the selection of one among several cards based on application criteria i.e. the one it most likely has to transact with.
