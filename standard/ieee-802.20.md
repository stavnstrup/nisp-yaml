  The IEEE 802.20 (or Mobile Broadband Wireless Access) Working Group was established on December 11, 2002 with the aim to develop a specification for an efficient packet based air interface that is optimized for the transport of IP based services. The goal is to enable worldwide deployment of affordable, always-on, and interoperable BWA networks for both business and residential end user markets. The group will specify the lower layers of the air interface, operating in licensed bands below 3.5 GHz and enabling peak user data rates exceeding 1 Mbit/s at speeds of up to 250 km/h
