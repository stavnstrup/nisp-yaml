  title: "Generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information â€” Part 6: Extensions for DSM-CC"
  date: "1998-10"
  version: "Ed 1"
applicability: >2
  The concepts and protocols of this part of ISO/IEC 138 18 (DSM-CC) provide the general capability to browse, select, download, and control a variety of bit stream types. DSM-CC also provides a mechanism to manage network and application resources through the concept of a Session, an associated collection of resources required to deliver a Service. The Session complements a Service Domain, a collection of interfaces to browse and select services, and control the delivery of bit streams.  DSM-CC defines the syntax and semantics for a set of User-to-Network and User-to-User protocols
