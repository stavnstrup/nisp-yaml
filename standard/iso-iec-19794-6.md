  version: ""
applicability: >2
    ISO/IEC 19794-6 2011 specifies iris image interchange formats for biometric enrolment, verification and identification systems. The image information might be stored as

    

  *  an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444, or

  *  an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444 that might be cropped around the iris, with the iris at the centre, and which might incorporate region-of-interest masking of non-iris regions.



    ISO/IEC 19794-6 2011 does not establish

    

  *  requirements on the optical specifications of cameras,

  *  requirements on photometric properties of iris images, or

  *  requirements on enrolment processes, workflow and use of iris equipment.
