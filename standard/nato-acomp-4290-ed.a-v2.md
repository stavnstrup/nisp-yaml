  title: "Standard for optical connector medium-rate and high-rate military tactical link"
  date: "2019-10-16"
  version: "(A)(2)"
applicability: >2
    This Standard is one of a series, which, when taken together, specify all the technical characteristics, parameters and procedures necessary for two NATO tactical, digital communication systems (networks) to interconnect and exchange traffic via a Gateway and/or interoperability points. The aim of this STANAG is to define the physical connector for use with fibre optical transmission for 

  *  Medium-Rate Military Tactical Link for use with the STANAG Gateway series 4206, 4578, etc. Support EOW and auxiliary channels and

  *  High-Rate Military Tactical Link for use with STANAGs 5067, 4637, etc.



    This STANAG addresses the optical interface (with optical connector, optical cable and other relevant functions) between different nations trough gateway and/or interoperability points. Two different optical interface families are defined in this Standard.

  *  Optical interface for medium-rate Military Tactical interconnection (Annex A). The medium-rate optical interface is for use in legacy system according to older editions of this Standard or under SLA (Service Level Agreements) between nations. This covers the optical cable, connector, transmission codes, frame alignment, engineering order-wire transmission and cable link performance monitoring.

  *  Optical interface for high-rate Military Tactical interconnection (Annex B). The high-rate optical interface is for use in high-rate military connection (Annex B). This covers the optical connector and a variety of optical fiber, the choice of which, depends on the application of the link.
