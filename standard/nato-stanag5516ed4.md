  Link-16 is a high capacity, secure, jam-resistant, nodeless broadcast-type RF data link that uses a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol. It provides information distribution, position location, and identification capabilities in an integrated form for tactical military operations. Link-16 utilises the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) or the Multi-Functional Information Distribution System (MIDS) terminals, and the protocols, conventions, and fixed word message formats defined by STANAG 5516. JTIDS/MIDS operates in the upper ultra high frequency Lx band.
