    In any national, multinational, coalition and NATO operation, all authoritative commanders require situational awareness about the precise disposition of all friendly forces at all times with the highest possible accuracy. This document outlines the basic technical and operational principles for using FFTS in an environment, where differing FFTS and FFTS-capable C2 Systems operate together by means of exchanging Friendly Force Information (FFI) messages listed in the NATO Message Catalogue (APP-11) [Ref 14]. It also provides the technical standard for exchanging FFI messages. The detailed FFI-message text format (MTF) is contained in the most recently ratified version of APP-11. In addition to the message format, this document defines mapping details for allowing data transfer between differing standards (i.e., FFI MTF to NFFI).

    This standard does not cover the system-specific protocols that connect Friendly Force Tracking Terminals with their connected Gateways.
