  IDEF1X is a method for designing relational databases with a syntax designed to support the semantic constructs necessary in developing a conceptual schema. A conceptual schema is a single integrated definition of the enterprise data that is unbiased toward any single application and independent of its access and physical storage. Because it is a design method, IDEF1X is not particularly suited to serve as an AS-IS analysis tool, although it is often used in that capacity as an alternative to IDEF1. IDEF1X is most useful for logical database design after the information requirements are known and the decision to implement a relational database has been made. Hence, the IDEF1X system perspective is focused on the actual data elements in a relational database. If the target system is not a relational system, for example, an object-oriented system, IDEF1X is not the best method.
