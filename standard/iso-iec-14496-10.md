  version: "Ed 7"
applicability: >2
  ISO/IEC 14496-10 2012 specifies advanced video coding for coding of audio-visual objects.  ISO/IEC 14496-10 2012 was developed in response to a growing need for higher compression of moving pictures for various applications such as digital storage media, television broadcasting, Internet streaming, and real-time audiovisual communication. ISO/IEC 14496-10 2012 specifies a coded video representation syntax and an associated decoding process that are suitable for use in a wide variety of applications and network environments.

    ISO/IEC 14496-10 2012 includes the specification of advanced video coding (AVC) and associated extensions to enable scalable video coding (SVC) and multiview video coding (MVC).
