  SMB provides a file and print sharing service which preserves, as well as is possible, the semantics of a DOS or MS Windows system to an application. SMB is the default protocol for resource sharing in an environment comprising Microsoft operating system based computers. Servers support either user-level and share-level security to cover all possible client workstation types.
