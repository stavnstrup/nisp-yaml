  This document defines the creation and management of Version 3 X.509 public-key certificates for use in applications requiring security services. These security services may be standalone or between networked computer-based systems. Such applications include, but are not limited to, electronic mail; storage or transmission of unclassified and classified information; signature of files, messages or electronic forms; contract formation signatures; and authentication of infrastructure components such as web servers, firewalls, and directories. The network backbone for these network security products may be unprotected networks such as the Internet, or protected networks such as National Defence Networks (NDNs) or the NATO General Communications System.
