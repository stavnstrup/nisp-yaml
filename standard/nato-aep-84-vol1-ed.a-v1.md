  title: "Standard Interfaces Of Unmanned Aircraft (UA) CONTROL System (UCS) for NATO UA Interoperability - Interface Control Document"
  date: "2017-04-05"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The objective of this STANAG is to facilitate communication between a UCS and different UAVs and their payloads as well as multiple C4I users. The implementation of the standard UCS architecture and the interfaces will also ease the system integration process of subsystems from different sources. This standardization will allow the continued utilisation and the integration of legacy systems. This STANAG is under the control of the NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG).
