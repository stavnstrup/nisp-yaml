  title: "Technical Characteristics of the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) - VOL I & II"
  date: "2014-03-14"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  MIDS is an advanced information distribution system that provides Communication, Navigation and Identification (CNI) capabilities in an integrated form for application to air, land and maritime tactical operations. These capabilities are provided in support of operational tasks through the ability of the system to 

  *  Distribute encrypted information at a high data rate in Electromagnetic Countermeasures (ECM) environments.

  *  Interconnect scattered sources of information such as surveillance, support, and intelligence on a continuing real time basis with selectable levels of connectivity among force elements such as weapon systems, weapon controllers and decision-making commanders.

  *  Provide mobile surface and airborne force elements with a relative navigation capability within a common position reference grid.

  *  Provide an identification capability through the dissemination of crypto-secure position, velocity, and identity information concerning both friendly and hostile force elements.
