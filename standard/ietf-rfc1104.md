  title: "Models of Policy Based Routing"
  date: "1989-06"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The purpose of these RFCs is,  to outline a variety of models for policy based routing. The relative benefits of the different approaches are reviewed;

    to have developed extensions to the IP architecture and the best-effort service model so that applications or end users can request specific quality (or levels) of service from an internetwork in addition to the current IP best-effort service;

    to have a glossary of policy-related terms. It provides abbreviations, explanations, and recommendations for use of these terms;

    to describe policy-based accounting which is an approach to provide flexibility to accounting architectures. Accounting policies describe the configuration of an accounting architecture in a standardised way. They are used to instrument the accounting architecture and can be exchanged between Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting (AAA) entities in order to share configuration information.
