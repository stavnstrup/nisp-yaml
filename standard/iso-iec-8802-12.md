  The above standard is applicable to systems requiring high-speed LAN services. 100VG-AnyLAN is a recent LAN standard based on deterministic principles. It can use a frame size up to 4096 bytes and is compatible with a wide choice of existing cabling standards. 100BaseT Ethernet probably offers superior throughput but 100VG-AnyLAN is more flexible and can handle time-critical traffic better.
