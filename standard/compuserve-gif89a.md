  Graphics Interchange Format is an industry proprietary specification published by CompuServe. GIF defines a protocol intended for the on-line transmission and interchange of raster graphic data in a way that is independent of the hardware used in the creation or display.  GIF is defined in terms of block and sub-blocks that contain relevant parameters and data used to reproduce a graphic. A GIF data stream is a sequence of protocol blocks and sub-blocks representing a collection of graphics. In general, the graphics in a data stream are assumed to be related to some degree, and to share some control information.

    The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) specifies a protocol for the on-line transmission and interchange of raster graphic data in a way that is independent of the hardware used in their creation or display. The GIF assumes that an error-free Transport Level Protocol is used for communications. It does not provide error-detection and error-correction capabilities.
