  title: "Interoperability between Ultra High Frequency Satellite Communications (UHF SATCOM) Terminals - Integrated Waveform (IW)"
  date: "2022-07-25"
  version: "1"
applicability: >2
    The Integrated Waveform (IW) is an enhancement to the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems. The IW enhancement will only affect the terminals (user radios) and the channel control segments of UHF SATCOM system but not the space segment of the UHF SATCOM system.

    The IW consists of three main annexes  the Interoperability Standard for Access to 5- kHz and 25-kHz SATCOM Channels (ANNEX B); the Interoperability Standard for UHF SATCOM DAMA Orderwire Messages and Protocols (ANNEX C); and the Interoperability Standard for Multiple-Access 5-kHz AND 25-kHz UHF SATCOM Channels (ANNEX D).

    The implementation of IW is developed in accordance with the International Standards Organization (ISO) Open System Interconnect (OSI) model. The ISO OSI implementation approach will organize the IW standards according to standardized protocol layers.
