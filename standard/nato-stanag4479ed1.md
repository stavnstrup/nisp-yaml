  pubnum: "STANAG 4479 Ed 1"
  title: "Parameters and Coding Standards for 800 bps Digital Speach Encoder/Decoder"
  date: "2002-02-25"
  version: "1"
applicability: >2
  The aim of this STANAG is to define 

  *  The voice digitizer characteristics, the coding tables and the bit format requirements at 800 bps;

  *  The error correction scheme and the interleaver to ensure compatability of digital voice produced using an overall bit rate of 2400 bps for slow frequency hopping HF-EPM transmission; and

  *  The End Of Transmission sequence for slow frequency hopping HF-EPM transmission.

    The point 1 and the annexes A, B, C, D of the STANAG describe a 800 bps coder useable as a stand alone voice coder in any transmission system needing a low bit rate order.

    The points 2 and 3 (and the related annexes F, G, H, I of the STANAG) are specifically aimed at transmission of the afore mentioned coder with the slow frequency hopping HF-EPM waveform.
