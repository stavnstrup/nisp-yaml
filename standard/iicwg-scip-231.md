  title: "Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol ECMQV/AES Cryptography Specification, rev.1.3"
  date: "2008-03-01"
  version: "1.1"
applicability: >2
  This document specifies the cryptography requirements and associated Interoperable Non-Type 1 Operational Modes for the Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) family of equipment. The key negotiation primitive is Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) MQV using the Full MQV scheme. AES-256 is the traffic encryption algorithm. The Certification Authority (CA) will generate X.509 Certificates to be delivered with the ECC static private component in key material loads that will be incorporated into a software download via PC compatible means. Counter mode cryptography will be used in conjunction with the AES algorithm. Encrypted Packet methodology for Traffic key validation is used. All standard SCIP voice and data applications are supported.  For details, contact AC/322 (SC/4).
