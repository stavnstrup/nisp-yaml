  title: "Generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information â€” Part 11: IPMP on MPEG-2 systems"
  date: "2004-02"
  version: "Ed 1"
applicability: >2
  ISO/IEC 13818-11 2004 specifies IPMP (Intellectual Property Management and Protection) on the MPEG-2 system. MPEG-2 IPMP offers flexibility, robustness and interoperability, which allows the secure content delivery in the MPEG-2 system. MPEG-2 IPMP can be used in combination with proprietary IPMP tools, which enables the implementation to various degrees of security for different business models, while maintaining the interoperability.  ISO/IEC 13818-11 2004 specifies 

    

  *  syntax and semantics for IPMP control information which includes tool list, tool container and rights container;

  *  syntax and semantics for IPMP descriptors, which facilitates IPMP protection signalling;

  *  syntax and semantics of IPMP data extending from the common base class IPMP_Data_BaseClass to support the following functionalities 

  *  mutual authentication for IPMP tool to IPMP tool as well as IPMP tool to terminal communication,

  *  the requesting by IPMP tools of the connection/disconnection to requested IPMP tools,

  *  the notification to IPMP tools of the connection/disconnection of IPMP tools,

  *  common IPMP processing,

  *  IPMP tool to/from user interaction;

  *  syntax and semantics for IPMP information carriage to and from IPMP tools;

  *  syntax and semantics for the request and transfer of content and IPMP tools between terminals;

  *  XML syntax and semantics for the description of the environment in which the MPEG-2 terminal/application is operating;

  *  a list of registration authorities required for the support of the specifications found herein.
