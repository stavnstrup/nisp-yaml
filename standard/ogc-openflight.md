  version: ""
applicability: >2
  A 3D scene description file format used for real-time visual simulation of 3D terrain features and moving models, such as ground and air vehicles.  OpenFlight was submitted to OGC for consideration as a community standard by its creator and maintainer,Â Presagis. While OpenFlight databases are often created and edited using Presagis software tools, the format is widely adopted and, as a result, many tools exist in the marketplace that are able to seamlessly read and write OpenFlight files.
