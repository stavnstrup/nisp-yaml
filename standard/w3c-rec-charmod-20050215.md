  This Architectural Specification provides authors of specifications, software developers, and content developers with a common reference for interoperable text manipulation on the World Wide Web, building on the Universal Character Set, defined jointly by the Unicode Standard and ISO/IEC 10646. Topics addressed include use of the terms 'character', 'encoding' and 'string', a reference processing model, choice and identification of character encodings, character escaping, and string indexing. For normalization and string identity matching, see the companion document Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0  Normalization [CharNorm]. For resource identifiers, see the companion document.
