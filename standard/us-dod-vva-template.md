  This standard establishes templates for the four core products of the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) processes  Accreditation Plan; V&V Plan; V&V Report, and Accreditation Report.  The templates provide a common framework and interfacing capability between the four documents (Accreditation Plan; V&V Plan; V&V Report, and Accreditation Report) and support consistency and efficiency. Additionally, the plans and reports produced by following the templates serve as a communications device between the participants in the VV&A processes. Specific templates for each document are found in the appendices.
