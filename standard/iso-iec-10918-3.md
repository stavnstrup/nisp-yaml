  title: "Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: Extensions"
  date: "1997-05"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This Recommendation | International Standard is applicable to continuous-tone grayscale or colour digital still image data. It is applicable to a wide range of applications which require use of compressed images.  This Recommendation | International Standard 

    

  *  defines extensions [including variable quantization, selective refinement, tiling, and a Still Picture Interchange File Format (SPIFF)] to processes for converting Source image data to compressed image data;

  *  defines extensions to processes for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data;

  *  defines coded representations for compressed image data;

  *  gives guidance and examples on how to implement these extensions in practice;

  *  describes compliance tests for these extensions.
