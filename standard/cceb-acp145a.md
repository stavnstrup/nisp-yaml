  title: "Interim Implementation Guide for ACP 123/STANAG 4406 Messaging Services Between Nations"
  date: "2008"
  version: "A"
applicability: >2
    ACP 123/STANAG 4406, ACP 133 and this Implementation Guide (ACP 145) define the standards for messaging, security and directory services required to achieve MM based on X.400 technology. Due to differences in national implementations of messaging services and, the complexity of achieving full end-to-end security services between nations including cross certification, messaging between Nations will use gateway services with security services provided using Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3 (V3) with its Enhanced Security Services (ESS) using a simplified security model. When all national implementations have implemented (interoperable) PKI, Message Security and, agree to cross certification, the interim solution contained within this document may become obsolete.

    This document details the requirements for the implementation of requirements for a common set of data structures and profiles for use between National ACP 123/STANAG 4406 based Military Message Handling Systems. The implementation of gateways to legacy ACP 127 or 128 systems is beyond the scope of this document. It is not intended to duplicate the text of any other document rather, provide references to other documents where these exist. Only where policy, procedures, standards or agreements are not formally documented elsewhere will full text be included.
