  This Technical Report was developed in response to the growing need for a generic coding method of moving pictures and of associated sound for various applications such as digital storage media, television broadcasting and communication. The use of this specification means that motion video can be manipulated as a form of computer data and can be stored on various storage media, transmitted and received over existing and future networks and distributed on existing and future broadcasting channels.  This Technical Report provides a C language software simulation of an encoder and decoder for Part 1 (Systems), Part 2 (Video), and Part 3 (Audio) of ISO/IEC 11172.
