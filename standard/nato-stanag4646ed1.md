  date: "2010-06-18"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This STANAG defines and specifies the protocols and messages to be distributed in a TACOMS Federated Network (TFN) for the purpose of network planning, management, and control.  It defines the applicable communication protocols at the layers above TCP/UDP, which are used to exchange the messages.

    It also defines the information contained within those messages, e.g., plans and profiles in the form of elements declared in XML.

    The selected protocols and messages refer widely to available commercial base standards.
