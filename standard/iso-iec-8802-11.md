applicability: >2
  The purpose of this standard is to provide wireless connectivity to automatic machinery, equipment, or stations that require rapid deployment, which may be portable or hand-hold, or which may be mounted on moving vehicles within a local area. This standard also offers regulatory bodies a means of standardising access to one or more frequency bands for the purpose of local area communication. ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-11 2012 defines one medium access control (MAC) and several physical layer (PHY) specifications for wireless connectivity for fixed, portable, and moving stations (STAs) within a local area.
