  This STANAG is to provide interoperability between NATO nations reconnaissance databases and product libraries by defining an interoperable interface to each nations? image library systems, without altering the internal architecture each individual system. This STANAG standardizes on the commands that pass back and forth between database systems and the clients as well as the parameters that can be used to search for a particular image in a remote database (e.g. date, time, and location).The interface relies on facilities and services to collaborate database request, reports and orders. The STANAG does not cover the delivery of the requested images to the requestor. It does recommend that products be delivered in STANAG 4545 format.
