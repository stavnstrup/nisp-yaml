  The document specifies the Service Information (SI) data which forms a part of DVB bitstreams, in order that the user can be provided with information to assist in selection of services and/or events within the bitstream, and so that the Integrated Receiver Decoder (IRD) can automatically configure itself for the selected service. SI data for automatic configuration is mostly specified within ISO/IEC 13818-1 [18] as Program Specific Information (PSI).
