  title: "GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery Encoding"
  date: "2018-07-09"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
    The GMLJP2 standard for Geographic Imagery Encoding Standard defines the means by which the Geography Markup Language (GML) standard is used within JPEG 2000 images for geographic imagery. The standard defines a means for encoding and packaging of CIS rectified and referenceable grid coverages and supporting structures within the XML boxes of the header of the JPEG 2000 data format. Thus, this document provides a way to georeference the data associated with the range sets of the coverage  that is, imagery and other gridded data contained in a JPEG 2000 file.

    The document in addition provides guidelines for the packaging of single as well as multiple codestreams, where each codestream represents a separate image or other gridded data. Further, this document provides guidelines for the enhancement of the following supporting structures and other data associated with CIS grid coverage domain sets  metadata, features, annotations, styles, coordinate reference systems, and units of measure.

    Finally, this document provides as a concrete implementation of this encoding standard an associated application schema that can be extended to include geometrical feature descriptions and annotations.
