  IEEE 802 local area networks (LANs) of all types may be connected together with media access control (MAC) bridges. IEEE Std 802.1Q specifies the operation of virtual local area network (VLAN) bridges, which support VLAN operation within an IEEE 802 bridged LAN. This Supplement to IEEE Std 802.1Q adds the facility for VLAN bridges to use multiple spanning trees, providing for traffic belonging to different VLANs to flow over potentially different paths within the virtual bridged LAN.
