  title: "OASIS ebXML Messaging Services Specification Ver 2.0"
  date: "2002-04-01"
  version: "2.0"
applicability: >2
  This specification defines a communications-protocol neutral method for exchanging electronic business messages. It defines specific Web Services-based enveloping constructs supporting reliable, secure delivery of business information. Furthermore, the specification defines a flexible enveloping technique, permitting messages to contain payloads of any format type. This versatility ensures legacy electronic business systems employing traditional syntaxes (i.e. UN/EDIFACT, ASC X12, or HL7) can leverage the advantages of the ebXML infrastructure along with users of emerging technologies.
