  This Standard specifies a suite of algorithms appropriate for applications which can be used to generate a digital signature. As a specific algorithm, it references the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). The DSA authenticates the integrity of the signed data and the identity of the signatory. It is used by the PCT within STANAG 4406 Ed.2.
