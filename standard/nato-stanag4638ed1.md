  The present STANAG specifies the minimum level of performance that is required from a TACOMS-Post-2000 (TACOMS) compliant Network Element (NE).  In particular, it defines the minimum number of Interoperability Points and of User Terminal Access Points that each type of TACOMS Network Element must provide, and its required minimum performance in terms of overall traffic handling capacity and quality of service for each of the five TACOMS Service Classes, as defined in STANAG 4637 (Head STANAG).

    The present STANAG also contains the NPRL and NPICS for each type of Network Element.
