    This Signaling Plan is intended to specify the end-to-end signaling used by the secure voice and data elements. Nothing will be contained in the Signaling Plan about the additional signaling within the communication links that might be used to convey the signaling between the terminal elements.

    The Signaling Plan is intended to define the SCIP overlay signaling for the clear digital voice and secure voice/data applications using a standard data bearer service. The SCIP clear digital voice mode signaling is based on the possibility that a voice-followed-by-data communications servic for the clear to secure mode transition may not exist. Note that the SCIP clear digital voice mode utilizes SCIP specific signaling and is compatible with SCIP devices only.
