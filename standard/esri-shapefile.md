  This document defines the shapefile (.shp) spatial data format and describes why shapefiles are important. It lists the tools available in Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI), software for creating shapefiles directly or converting data into shapefiles from other formats. This document also provides all the technical information necessary for writing a computer program to create shapefiles without the use of ESRI software for organizations that want to write their own data translators.
