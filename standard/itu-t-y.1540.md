  Recommendation ITU-T Y.1540 defines parameters that may be used in specifying and assessing the performance of speed, accuracy, dependability and availability of IP packet transfer of international Internet Protocol (IP) data communication services. The defined parameters apply to end-to-end, point-to-point IP service and to the network portions that provide, or contribute to the provision of, such service in accordance with the normative references specified in clause 2. Connectionless transport is a distinguishing aspect of the IP service that is considered in this Recommendation.
