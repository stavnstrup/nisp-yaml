  date: "2018-01-31"
  version: "Rel 17.5.0"
applicability: >2
    This standard is the specification of the REST API for Site Management. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations for SID GeographicSite entity.

    The API covers the operations to manage (create, read, delete) sites that can be associated to a customer, an account, a service delivery or other entities. It defines a Site as a convenience class that allows to easily refer to places important to other entities, where a geographic place is the entity that can answer the question “where?”, allowing to determine where things are in relation to the earth's surface, and can be represented either in a textual structured way (geographic address) or as a geometry referred to a spatial reference system (geographic location)
