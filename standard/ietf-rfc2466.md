  This document is one in the series of documents that define various MIB object groups for IPv6. Specifically, the ICMPv6 group is defined in this document.  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the IPv6-based internets.

    This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions.
