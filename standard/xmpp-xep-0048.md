  For ease-of-use in a Jabber client, it is desirable to have a way to store shortcuts to various services and resources (such as conference rooms and web pages) as bookmarks that can be displayed in the user's client. Several Jabber clients have already agreed on and implemented a method to provide this service; that informal agreement is documented and expanded upon in this document. In particular, we introduce the <storage/> element (qualified by the 'storage bookmarks' namespace) as a container for this sort of this data. While bookmarks data can be stored using any XML storage mechanism, this document recommends one method that is specific to XMPP.
