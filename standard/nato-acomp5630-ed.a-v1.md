    The Narrowband Waveform (NBWF) provides ground–ground interoperability over air between troops/platforms of different nations at the tactical battlefield using the military VHF and UHF band (30 - 500 MHz). By narrowband we understand RF bandwidths of less than 100 kHz – normally 25 kHz. Combined 25 kHz channels may allow higher data rates over shorter ranges.
