  title: "IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"
  date: "2003-12"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The Prefix Delegation options provide a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This mechanism is intended for delegating a long-lived prefix from a delegating router to a requesting router, across an administrative boundary, where the delegating router does not require knowledge about the topology of the links in the network to which the prefixes will be assigned.
