  Arcadia is a model-based engineering method for systems, hardware and software architectural design. It has been developed by Thales between 2005 and 2010 through an iterative process involving operational architects from all the Thales business domains. Arcadia promotes a viewpoint-driven approach (as described in ISO/IEC 42010) and emphasizes a clear distinction between need and solution.
