  title: "MHEG Part 3: MHEG script interchange representation"
  date: "1997-05"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The scope of this part of ISO/IEC 13522 is to extend the coded representation of the MHEG script object class defined by another part of ISO/IEC 13522, including ISO/IEC 13522-1 and ISO/IEC 13522-5.  This part of ISO/IEC 13522 specifies the MHEG script interchange representation (MHEG-SIR) for the contents of script objects, i.e. the encoding of the script data component of the MHEG script class.

    MHEG engines are system or application components that handle, interpret and present MHEG objects. This part of ISO/IEC 13522 also specifies the semantics of interchanged scripts. These semantics are defined in terms of minimum requirements on the behaviour of MHEG engines that support the interpretation of interchanged scripts.

    This part of ISO/IEC 13522 is applicable to all applications that interchange multimedia and hypermedia information.
