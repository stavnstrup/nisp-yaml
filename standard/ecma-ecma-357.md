  This Standard adds native XML datatypes to the ECMAScript language, extends the semantics of familiar ECMAScript operators for manipulating XML data and adds a small set of new operators for common XML operations, such as searching and filtering. It also adds support for XML literals, namespaces, qualified names and other mechanisms to facilitate XML processing.
