  title: "The Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (DSR) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks for IPv4"
  date: "2007-02"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is a routing protocol for wireless mesh networks. It is similar to AODV in that it forms a route on-demand when a transmitting computer requests one. However, it uses source routing instead of relying on the routing table at each intermediate device.
