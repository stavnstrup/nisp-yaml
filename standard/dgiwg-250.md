  title: "Defense Gridded Elevation Data (DGED) Product Implementation Profile"
  date: "2020-10-02"
  version: "1.2.1"
applicability: >2
    This product implementation profile for gridded elevation data products has been developed to support defence requirements for a uniform, orthogonal grid-based geospatial elevation model for a wide range of geospatial resolutions, in order to ensure interoperability between implementations of elevation products (and their specifications).

    This profile specifies the content, structure, multi-level grid system and tiling-scheme, as well as delivery and encoding format for gridded elevation products in support of elevation data storage, access, exploitation and exchange.
