    Provides a standardized client interface to an Address management system. It allows looking for worldwide addresses. It can also be used to validate geographic address data, to be sure that it corresponds to a real geographic address. Finally, it can be used to look for a geographic address by  searching an area as a start (city, town â€¦), then zooming on the streets of this area, and finally listing all the street segments (numbers) in a street.
