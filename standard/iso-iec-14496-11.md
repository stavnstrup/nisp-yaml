  title: "Coding of audio-visual objects â€” Part 11: Scene description and application engine"
  date: "2005-12"
  version: "Ed 1"
applicability: >2
  ISO/IEC 14496-11 2005 specifies the coded representation of interactive audio-visual scenes and applications.  It specifies the following tools 

    

  *  the coded representation of the spatio-temporal positioning of audio-visual objects as well as their behaviour in response to interaction (scene description);

  *  the coded representation of synthetic two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) objects that can be manifested audibly and/or visually;;

  *  the Extensible MPEG-4 Textual (XMT) format, a textual representation of the multimedia content described in ISO/IEC 14496 using the Extensible Markup Language (XML); and

  *  a system level description of an application engine (format, delivery, lifecycle, and behaviour of dowloadable Java byte code applications).
