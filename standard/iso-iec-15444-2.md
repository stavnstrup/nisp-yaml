  ISO/IEC 15444-2 2004 defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, grey-scale, colour digital still images, or multi-component images.  ISO/IEC 15444-2 2004 

    

  *  specifies extended decoding processes for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data;

  *  specifies a codestream syntax containing information for interpreting the compressed image data;

  *  specifies an extended file format;

  *  specifies a container to store image metadata;

  *  defines a standard set of image metadata;

  *  provides guidance on extended encoding processes for converting source image data to compressed image data;

  *  provides guidance on how to implement these processes in practice.
