  High Performance Radio Metropolitan Area Network (HIPERMAN) is a standard created by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Broadband Radio Access Networks (BRAN) group to provide a wireless network communication in the 2 - 11 GHz bands across Europe and other countries which follow the ETSI standard. HIPERMAN is a European alternative to WiMAX (or the IEEE 802.16 standard) and the Korean technology WiBro.  HIPERMAN is aiming principally for providing broadband Wireless DSL, while covering a large geographic area. The standardization focuses on broadband solutions optimized for access in frequency bands below 11 GHz (mainly in the 3.5 GHz band). HIPERMAN is optimised for packet switched networks, and supports fixed and nomadic applications, primarily in the residential and small business user environments.
