  This document describes the syntax and semantics for a compact string representation for a resource available via the Internet. These strings are called Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).  The specification is derived from concepts introduced by the World- Wide Web global information initiative, whose use of such objects dates from 1990 and is described in Universal Resource Identifiers in WWW, RFC 1630. The specification of URLs is designed to meet the requirements laid out in Functional Requirements for Internet Resource Locators.
