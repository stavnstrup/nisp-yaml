  title: "NATO Core Metadata Specification"
  date: ""
  version: ""
applicability: >2
    The aim of this agreement is to respond to the following interoperability requirements.

  *  To define a core set of elements, organized in a hierarchical structure that supports the core NATO information management tasks defined by the NIMP and PDIM. The NATO Core Metadata Specification (NCMS) itself is COI-independent, i.e. it does not contain any elements for COI-specific use. However, it is intended to be extensible and allows the inclusion of COI metadata elements to augment the core specification.



    The specification described in this document replaces the NATO Discovery Metadata Specification (NDMS). Although the NDMS had a similar overall scope as the NCMS in providing a core set of elements for capturing administrative, descriptive, and security metadata, it was primarily focused on supporting the discovery of resources. Acknowledging that this focus is too narrow, the NCMS as the successor provides additional support for information management tasks such as retention and disposition, downgrading, and disclosure, as well as the confidentiality labelling of resources and the associated metadata in accordance with existing and upcoming NATO standards.
