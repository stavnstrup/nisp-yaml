applicability: >2
  In support of military applications, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) has developed standard digital datasets (Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) which is a uniform matrix of terrain elevation values providing basic quantitative data for systems and applications that require terrain elevation, slope, and/or surface roughness information. DTED is the DIGEST standard for gridded data. DTED data are distributed in a standardised system of recording terrain elevation data on CD-ROM. This format is primarily for data storage and exchange Each DTED (level 1) is arranged in 1-degree-by-1-degree geographic areas. Elevation matrix intervals vary according to latitude DTED files are designed to be contiguous. Adjacent files have no gaps and overlaps only along adjacent boundaries. The terrain elevation data is expressed in meters. DTED is compliant with ISO/IEC 8211 1994
