  title: "Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Using Integer Factorization Cryptography"
  date: "2019-08-28"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
    This Recommendation is intended for use in conjunction with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-57. This key-establishment Recommendation, SP 800-57, and FIPS 186 are intended to provide information for a vendor to implement secure key-establishment using asymmetric algorithms in FIPS 1406 validated modules.

    Note that a key-establishment scheme is a component of a protocol that may provide security properties not provided by the scheme when considered by itself; protocols, per se, are not specified in this Recommendation
