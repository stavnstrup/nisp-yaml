  date: "2003-11"
  version: "Ed 1"
applicability: >2
  ISO/IEC 14496-14 2003 specifies the MP4 file format as derived from ISO/IEC 14496-12 and ISO/IEC 15444-12, the ISO base media file format. It revises and completely replaces Clause 13 of ISO/IEC 14496-1, in which the file format was previously specified.  The MP4 file format defines the storage of MPEG-4 content in files. It is a flexible format, permitting a wide variety of usages, such as editing, display, interchange and streaming.
