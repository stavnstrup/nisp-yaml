  The Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP) is a generalized systems engineering process for building and executing distributed simulation applications. The DSEEP standard is a valuable reference for anyone who needs to support the design, development or interoperability of simulation applications including live systems. The benefit is that it addresses multiple stages of development and it can be applied to multiple architectures.
