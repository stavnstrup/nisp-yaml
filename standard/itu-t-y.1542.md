applicability: >2
  This Recommendation considers various approaches toward achieving end-to-end (UNI-UNI) IP network performance objectives. Detailed examples are provided as to how some approaches might work in practice, including how service providers might handle cases where the aggregated impairments exceed those specified in a requested QoS class (such as those of ITU-T Rec. Y.1541). The pros and cons of each approach are summarized.
