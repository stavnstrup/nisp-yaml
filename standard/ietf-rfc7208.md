  title: "Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1"
  date: "2014-04"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  Email on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways. In particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the MAIL FROM of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands. This document describes version 1 of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby Administrative Management Domains (ADMDs) can explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use their domain names, and a receiving host can check such authorization.
