  It has been recognized that there are requirements for simulating Link 11/11B in both DIS and HLA. This standard provides definitions, guidance, and standardization required for this purpose.  For the DIS implementation, Link 11/11B messages are described in terms of the established DIS Transmitter and Signal Protocol Data Units (PDUs). For the HLA implementation, Link 11/11B messages are described in terms of HLA instructions formatted in compliance with the IEEE 1516 standard. These instructions are presented in the form of a Base Object Model (BOM) that may be incorporated into a system FOM. RPR-FOM based simulations should be able to easily integrate the Link 11/11B BOM into their FOMs.
