  title: "NATO Core Metadata Specification"
  date: "2022-11-18"
  version: "(A)(1)"
applicability: >2
    This document defines a set of commonly used NATO Core Metadata elements to support information management within the Alliance and provides guidance on the implementation of the specification, including the appropriate XML schema definitions. It expand upon existing standards wherever appropriate and possible and provide a description of the core set of metadata elements and the mechanism with which the metadata can be associated with an information object.

    This specification encourages information sharing by providing a single mediation standard that organisations, enterprises and communities of interest can adopt to provide the interoperable metadata elements for information.

    This document is the one of the three documents that provide the key components of a consistent, interoperable, metadata infrastructure 

  

  *  ADatP-4774 – Confidentiality Metadata Label Syntax, which provides support for the Security Layer metadata elements

  *  ADatP-4778 – Metadata Binding Mechanism, which describes how to consistently bind metadata (of any sort) to a finite data object

  *  ADatP-5636 (this document) NATO Core Metadata Specification – which defines the core set of metadata elements that should be used to support interoperable information exchange.
