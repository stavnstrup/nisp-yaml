  title: "MHEG Part 5: Support for base-level interactive applications"
  date: "1997-04"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This part of ISO/IEC 13522 specifies semantics and final-form interchange syntax for MHEG-5 objects, based on concepts defined in ISO/IEC 13522-1. These objects are intended for use in the domain of simple client/server interactive multimedia applications, e.g. (Near) Video on Demand applications, navigation and browsing applications.  Since it is expected that this part of ISO/IEC 13522 be used for interoperability of applications across platforms, the scope focuses on a specific and precise definition of MHEG-5 classes. This part of ISO/IEC 13522 recognises the semantics implied by the specification of the MHEG-5 objects and by interpretation of MHEG-5 behaviours within the using system.

    The scope excludes any standardisation of models, services, systems, protocols or applications that are likely to make use of MHEG-5 objects.

    The coded representation of content data is not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 13522.
