  title: "Link 16 Simulation"
  date: "2006-07-10"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  A standard for Link 16 message exchange and JTIDS network simulation in the DIS and HLA interoperability frameworks.  The intent is to prescribe the content of the standard fields of the Transmitter and Signal PDUs (and the corresponding RPR-FOM Transmitter Object and Signal Interaction) and establish procedures for their use. Compliance with these procedures will facilitate interoperability among Link 16 simulation systems.
