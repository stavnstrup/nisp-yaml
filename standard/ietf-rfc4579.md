  title: "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Call Control - Conferencing for User Agents"
  date: "2006-08"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This specification defines conferencing call control features for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This document builds on the Conferencing Requirements and Framework documents to define how a tightly coupled SIP conference works. The approach is explored from the perspective of different user agent (UA) types  conference-unaware, conference-aware, and focus UAs. The use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in conferencing, OPTIONS for capabilities discovery, and call control using REFER are covered in detail with example call flow diagrams. The usage of the isfocus feature tag is defined.
