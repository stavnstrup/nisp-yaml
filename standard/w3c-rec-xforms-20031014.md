  XForms is an XML application that represents the next generation of forms for the Web. By splitting traditional XHTML forms into three parts - XForms model, instance data, and user interface - it separates presentation from content, allows reuse, gives strong typing - reducing the number of round-trips to the server, as well as offering device independence and a reduced need for scripting.
