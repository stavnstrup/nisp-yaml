  title: "Address Allocation for Private Internets"
  date: "1996-02"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This document describes address allocation for private internets. The allocation permits full network layer connectivity among all hosts inside an enterprise as well as among all public hosts of different enterprises. The cost of using private internet address space is the potentially costly effort to renumber hosts and networks between public and private.
