  title: "Profile for the Use of S/MIME protocols Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME"
  date: "2008-06-04"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The aim of the STANAG is to define a profile for the use of the S/MIME protocols Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] and Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [ESS], for adding cryptographic services to messaging objects. For X.400 objects, this document supplements the two IETF Drafts ?Securing X.400 Content with S/MIME? [x400Wrap] and ?Transporting S/MIM Objects in X.400? [x400Transport].  The S/MIME protocols Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] and Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [ESS], leave the vendors with many options that has to be agreed on in order to achieve interoperability. This document is a profile for the use of the standards [CMS] and [ESS], and describes which of the different elements of service that has to be present on origination and reception of a message, in order to claim conformance to this profile.

    For X.400 contents (e.g. P22, P772), this document supplements the two IETF RFC Drafts ?Securing X.400 Content with S/MIME? [x400Wrap] an ?Transporting S/MIME Objects in X.400? [x400Transport].
