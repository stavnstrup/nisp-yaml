  Defines the format and syntax for describing the elements of a template for representing BOMs. Base Object Models (BOMs) provide a component framework for facilitating interoperability, reuse, and composability. The BOM concept is based on the assumption that piece-parts of models, simulations, and federations can be extracted and reused as modeling building-blocks or components. The interplay within a simulation or federation can be captured and characterized in the form of reusable patterns. These patterns of interplay are sequences of events between simulation elements. The representation of the pattern of interplay is captured in the BOM.
