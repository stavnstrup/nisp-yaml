  title: "Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)"
  date: "2016-04"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
    This specification describes how to declare in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular proof-of- possession key and how the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof of possession of the key by the presenter. Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.
