  The Urban Combat Advanced Training Technology (UCATT) Live Simulation Standards and Architecture are aimed at providing joint and combined military training through the ability to interconnect live simulation training systems.  Combat Training Centres contain a multitude of interfaces over which data is sent and received before, during and after an exercise. UCATT has identified some of those interfaces to be internal (only of interest to the system itself) and some to be external interfaces (data sent to outside of the system). To achieve full interoperability, all or most interfaces will need to be standardized.
