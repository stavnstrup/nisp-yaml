  title: "Profile for HF radio data communications"
  date: "2015-03-30"
  version: "Ed 3"
applicability: >2
  This STANAG describes a profile for data communication over HF radio, nominally for beyond-line-of-sight circuits. The technical characteristics that are required to ensure interoperability and reliable system operation are described in the main body of and mandatory annexes to this STANAG.  The HF profile provides interoperability at the two major interfaces  first, the common air interface, describing how information is exchanged between nodes by radio; and second, the non-HF interfaces which allow external users or clients to interact with the subnetwork and with each other over the subnetwork. While physical interfaces are left up to the system implementer (e.g., Ethernet, FDDI, internal bus, or shared memory), the data formats (primitives) and procedures that make up the interface are specified in detail so that client applications can make use of the subnet.
