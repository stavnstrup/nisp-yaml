  title: "XEP-0127: Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) Over XMPP"
  date: "2004-12-09"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an open format for alerts and notifications, defined by OASIS. CAP was developed to address the call, published in a (U.S.) National Science and Technology Council report, for a standard method ... to collect and relay instantaneously and automatically all types of hazard warnings and reports. Given that the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (see XMPP Core) provides a near-real-time transport mechanism for structured information, and that CAP is defined as an XML data format, it makes sense to define a way to transport CAP information over XMPP. Such a method is defined herein.
