  ISO/IEC 9075 defines Structured Query Language (SQL). The scope of SQL is the definition of data structure and the operations on data stored in that structure. ISO/IEC 9075-1, ISO/IEC 9075-2 and ISO/IEC 9075-11 encompass the minimum requirements of the language. Other parts define extensions.  ISO/IEC 9075-2 2011 defines the data structures and basic operations on SQL-data. It provides functional capabilities for creating, accessing, maintaining, controlling, and protecting SQL-data. Both static and dynamic variants of the language are proved. In addition to direct invocation, bindings are provided for the programming languages Ada, C, COBOL, Fortran, M, Pascal, and PL/I.
