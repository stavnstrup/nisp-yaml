  1000Base-T provides half-duplex (CSMA/CD) and full-duplex 1000 Mb/s Ethernet service over Category 5 links as defined by ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-A. Topology rules for 1000Base-T are the same as those used for 100Base-T (100VG-AnyLAN). Category 5 link length are limited to 100 meters by the ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-A cabling standard. Only one CSMA/CD repeater will be allowed in a collision domain.
