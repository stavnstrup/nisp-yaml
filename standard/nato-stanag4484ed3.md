  The purpose of this standard is to provide a system level definition of SHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) to achieve interoperability between allied systems. This standard provides the basis to achieve interoperable communications over existing nonprocessing transponders (NATO, DSCS, SKYNET, etc.) and future SHF satellites.
