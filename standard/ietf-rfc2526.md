  title: "Reserved IPv6 Subnet Anycast Addresses"
  date: "1999-03"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The IP Version 6 addressing architecture defines an anycast address as an IPv6 address that is assigned to one or more network interfaces (typically belonging to different nodes), with the property that a packet sent to an anycast address is routed to the nearest interface having that address, according to the routing protocols' measure of distance. This document defines a set of reserved anycast addresses within each subnet prefix, and lists the initial allocation of these reserved subnet anycast addresses.
