  WebLVC is a protocol for enabling web and mobile applications (typically JavaScript applications running in a web browser) to play in traditional M&S federations (which may be using Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High Level Architecture (HLA), Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), or related protocols and architectures).   WebLVC enables web-based applications that simplify and expand the reach of live, virtual, or constructive simulations. It allows the observation, control, and participation in your simulation from any computer or mobile device with a compatible web browser and access to your simulation network.
