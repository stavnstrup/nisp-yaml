applicability: >2
  The DCE DTS provides a provable, bounded time over an arbitrary network. This standard is recommended only if used in conjunction with other OSF DCE components (e.g. DCE Kerberos-based authentication services). The potential benefit of adopting the DCE DTS is a coherent distributed computing solution, assuming that DCE DTS is used in conjunction with other OSF DCE services. The main risk is the complexity of DCE.
