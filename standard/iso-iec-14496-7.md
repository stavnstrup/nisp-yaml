  title: "Coding of audio-visual objects â€” Part 7: Optimized reference software for coding of audio-visual objects"
  date: "2004-10"
  version: "Ed 2"
applicability: >2
  ISO/IEC TR 14496-7 2004 specifies the encoding tools that enhance both the execution and quality for the coding of visual objects as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-2. There are five visual tools, including   

  *  Fast Motion Estimation;

  *  Fast Global Motion Estimation;

  *  Fast and Robust Sprite Generation;

  *  Optimized Reference Software for Simple Profile with Fast Variable Length Decoder Technique; and

  *  Error Resilience Tools with RVLC.



    The platform specific optimization is not currently addressed. The error resilience tools are separately implemented based on the Momusys reference software.
