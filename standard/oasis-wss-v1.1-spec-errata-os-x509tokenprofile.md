  title: "Web Services Security X.509 Certificate Token Profile 1.1 OASIS Standard incorporating Approved Errata"
  date: "2006-11-01"
  version: "1.1"
applicability: >2
  This specification describes the use of the X.509 authentication framework with the Web Services Security  SOAP Message Security specification [WS-Security]. An X.509 certificate specifies a binding between a public key and a set of attributes that includes (at least) a subject name, issuer name, serial number and validity interval. This binding may be subject to subsequent revocation advertised by mechanisms that include issuance of CRLs, OCSP tokens or mechanisms that are outside the X.509 framework, such as XKMS.
