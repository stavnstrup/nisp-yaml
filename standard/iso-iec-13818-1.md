  ISO/IEC 13818-1 2013 specifies the system layer of the coding. It was developed principally to support the combination of the video and audio coding methods defined in ISO/IEC 13818-2 and ISO/IEC 13818-3. The system layer supports six basic functions   

  *  the synchronization of multiple compressed streams on decoding;

  *  the interleaving of multiple compressed streams into a single stream;

  *  the initialization of buffering for decoding start up;

  *  continuous buffer management;

  *  time identification;

  *  multiplexing and signalling of various components in a system stream.
