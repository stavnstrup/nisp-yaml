    The availability of aeronautical meteorological information in an interoperable digital format is a key enabler for the future of global air traffic management (ATM) within a system-wide information management (SWIM) environment. Therefore, this manual provides guidance on the practices to be used for the implementation of aeronautical meteorological data exchange models in digital format. While the body of the manual is primarily based on Annex 3 - Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation and on digital information exchange principles, it also contains detailed guidance on the following information 

  

  *  space weather exchange;

  *  volcanic ash and tropical cyclone advisories;

  *  METAR and SPECI, TAF;

  *  SIGMET; and

  *  AIRMET.

    This information is available in digital form, formatted in accordance with a globally interoperable information exchange model using extensible mark-up language (XML)/geography mark-up language (GML) and accompanied by the appropriate metadata.
