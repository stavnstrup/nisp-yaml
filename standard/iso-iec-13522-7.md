  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This part of ISO/IEC 13522 tests conformance of the behaviour of an MHEG engine. It does not validate the physical presentation of MHEG-5 objects.  The test suite comprises a set of test cases and a corresponding set of test objects. The test cases are defined in terms of 

    

  *  test purpose;

  *  objects and procedures which are to be used to test one or more MHEG-5 features;

  *  expected result.



    A set of content data will be provided for the test objects. These content data are intended as a guide for generating a test suite and should be converted or replaced by content formats appropriate to the Application Domain.

    A test suite for an Application Domain shall be generated by using the PICS template in subclause 9.2.1 PICS Template.
