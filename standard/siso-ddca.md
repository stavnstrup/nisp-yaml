  An object model that is designed to specify the states and behaviors required for multiple discrete debrief systems to interoperate during a distributed debrief (DD) event.Â  Exercise replay is a common element of debriefing systems. Many tool vendors implement exercise replay using a variety of techniques and possess unique capabilities meeting the specific needs of the program. When these systems need to be integrated into a larger distributed debrief spanning multiple sites, problems arise due to a lack of an interoperable standard. This standard specifies the control aspects of a distributed debrief.
