  Wireless Broadband (WiBro) was developed by the Korean telecoms industry. It adapts TDD for duplexing, OFDMA for multiple access and 8.75MHz as a channel bandwidth. WiBro was devised to overcome the speed limitation of mobile phone (for example CDMA 1x) and to add mobility to broadband Internet (for example ADSL or Wireless LAN). In February 2002, the Korean government allocated 100 MHz of electromagnetic spectrum in the 2.3 - 2.4 GHz band, and in late 2004 WiBro Phase 1 was standardized by the TTA of Korea and in late 2005 ITU reflected WiBro as IEEE 802.16e.
