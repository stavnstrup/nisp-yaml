  title: "MHEG Part 6: Support for enhanced interactive applications"
  date: "1998-10"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  The scope of this part of ISO/IEC 13522 is to define the semantics and final-form coded representation for the interchange of enhanced interactive multimedia applications.  These applications extend applications covered by ISO/IEC 13522-5 in incorporating functionality such as computing (data processing) and extended communication with the external environment, including servers, local devices, etc.

    These applications may be exploited in any communication environment including broadcast-only mode, interactive client-server or peer-to-peer (conversational). However, the main focus is on interactive retrieval (client-server) applications running on limited resource set-top-units involving asymmetrical data interchange with real-time audiovisuals on the downstream channel.

    The coded representation defined by this part of ISO/IEC 13522 specialises the coded representation defined by ISO/IEC 13522-5. Especially, this part of ISO/IEC 13522 defines the coded representation for the OriginalContent attribute of the MHEG-5 InterchangedProgram class. In addition, this part of ISO/IEC 13522 defines the Applet class; this subclass of InterchangedProgram features the ability to manage its own display and interaction, by delegation from the engine.
