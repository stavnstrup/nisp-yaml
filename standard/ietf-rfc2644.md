  title: "Changing the Default for Directed Broadcasts in Routers"
  date: "1999-08"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  Router Requirements specifies that routers must receive and forward directed broadcasts. It also specifies that routers MUST have an option to disable this feature, and that this option MUST default to permit the receiving and forwarding of directed broadcasts. While directed broadcasts have uses, their use on the Internet backbone appears to be comprised entirely of malicious attacks on other networks.  Changing the required default for routers would help ensure new routers connected to the Internet do not add to the problems already present.
