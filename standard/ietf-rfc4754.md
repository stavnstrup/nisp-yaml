  title: "IKE and IKEv2 Authentication Using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"
  date: "2007-01"
  version: ""
applicability: >2
  This document describes how the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) may be used as the authentication method within the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocols. ECDSA may provide benefits including computational efficiency, small signature sizes, and minimal bandwidth compared to other available digital signature methods. This document adds ECDSA capability to IKE and IKEv2 without introducing any changes to existing IKE operation.
