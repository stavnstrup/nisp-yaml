The NISP tools is continously being updated, but only officially released once a year.

In order for the members of IP CaT to keep up with the development, this page provides online access to draft HTML5 and PDF editions of the NISP and the database viewer.

The sources to the documents are stored in a Git repository at GitHub.

- Any change to the NISP tool/document repository will immediately trigger a continous integration /   continous delivery pipeline. This results in a new version of NISP and an updated statistical overview of the standards and profiles.
